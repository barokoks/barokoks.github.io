Why Are Hospital CEOs Paid So Well? The Atlantic.</h3><p>Dividing the total spending on robotic technology by the total number of robotic procedures performed in 2017 yielded a cost per procedure of $3,568, with $1,866 for instruments and accessories, $1,038 for robot systems, and $663 for the service contract.

We examined a consecutive case series of 348 patients undergoing abdominal (ah), vaginal (vh), laparoscopic (lh), or robotic hysterectomy (rh) for benign conditions between january 2015 and march. One of the main reasons for the slow uptake of robotic surgery in the uk is the enormous cost of acquiring the da vinci robot, which currently stands at about £1.7 million.</p>
