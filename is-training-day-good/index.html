Training Day (CBS) &#34;You�re A Good Man, Kyle&#34; Promo HD 30s YouTube From youtube.com
Maintaining the same balance of macronutrients on training days and rest days has proven to work best for us and our clients. Training day (2001) directed by antoine fuqua. Training 6 days a week (black curve) is better for muscle growth than 2 days a week (grey curve), because the total area under the back curve is higher than the area under the grey curve (the time muscle are built). Encourage everyone in the training session to speak freely and candidly, because learning occurs most readily when feelings are involved.
