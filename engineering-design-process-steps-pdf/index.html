<p>Technology, Engineering, &amp; Design Mrs. Furse�s Virtual Classroom Many times the solution to a problem involves designing a product (like a machine or computer code) that meets certain criteria and/or accomplishes a certain task. The steps include problem solving processes such as, for example, determining your objectives and constraints, prototyping, testing and evaluation. Observe the phenomenon in the video below.

Their solutions cannot normally be found by applying mathematical formulas or algorithms in a routine or structured way. That engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet. Engineers will repeat the design process cycle several times, tweaking and changing their design slightly each time. Use the spaces provided to show your work.
