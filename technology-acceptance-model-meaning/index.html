<p>Technostress, managing stress, technophobia, technology acceptance The technology acceptance model proposes that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness predict the acceptance of information technology. The technology acceptance model (tam) is an information systems theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The purpose of this model is to predict the acceptability of a tool and to identify the modifications which must.</p>

<p>[PDF] A Theoretical Integration of User Satisfaction and Technology The technology acceptance model was originally defined by davis (1989), but it has subsequently been modified and augmented by other researchers. Technology acceptance models aim at studying how individual perceptions affect the intentions to use information technology as well as the actual usage. The model itself is general, but it can be very useful for enterprises that are implementing software.</p>
