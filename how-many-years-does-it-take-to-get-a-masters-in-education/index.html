Ranked The salary bump you can expect from a graduate degree, by major From qz.com
The average length of a master�s program in education varies by specialization. This type of masters degree combines four years of undergraduate studies and two years of graduate school and gives people the opportunity to complete both within five years. Alternatively, a graduate certificate can give you a taster before committing to a master qualification. Typically, a master’s degree can be completed in about half the time, but this does not make the path to graduation easier.
