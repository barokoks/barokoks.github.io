Life Sciences Securing cloud computing environment by mitigating DDoS From lifesciencesjournals.blogspot.com
Image recognition operates in fully observable domains. Artificial intelligence finds application in a wide array of environmental sectors, including natural resource conservation, wildlife protection, energy management, clean energy, waste management, pollution control and agriculture. Properties of environment discrete / continuous − if there are a limited number of distinct, clearly defined, states of the environment, the environment is discrete (for example, chess); By 2030, the tech could help cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 4%.
