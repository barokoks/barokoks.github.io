<p>Robot judges �will pass sentence with no human bias� in AI courts It�s not exactly news to state that robots can be an effective tool for law enforcement in a wide variety of incidents. The use of “police robots” is becoming more common in law enforcement due to the 1997 1033 program, a program that allows for military surplus gear to be given to law enforcement agencies.
