What Is Artificial Intelligence? Business Division From business-division.co.uk
In 1956, the term “artificial intelligence” was coined by john mccarthy at the dartmouth conference that formally laid the foundation of ai as a discipline. According to forbes.com, “artificial intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart.” computers that are authentically utilizing ai technology are taught to think and learn for themselves, just like humans. The aim is to increase chance of success and not accuracy. Ml is a set of algorithms that enables computers to learn from previous outcomes and.
