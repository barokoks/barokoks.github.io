<p>Learning Curve Psynso This curve is called the learning curve. The learning curve theory puts its onus on the fact that when a new activity commences, the engaged workforce will not be able to achieve maximum efficiency at the beginning. Usually shown as a simple graph, it often depicts the combination of the time it takes to learn a new idea or skill.</p>

The same theory can be applied to find the average cost per unit as well as the average time.

It focuses on the idea that people learn and grow when they form connections. More specifically, it is derived from statistical findings that as cumulative production doubles, cumulative average time required per unit will be reduced by some constant percentage, say 10% to 20%. This curve is very important in cost analysis, cost estimation and efficiency studies. One of the most common transformative learning examples is gaining knowledge of the responsibilities involved and obtaining practical experience of the role of a senior member that is in a position that you desire to be in.</p>
