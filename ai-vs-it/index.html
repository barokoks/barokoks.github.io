There are three main categories of ai: Accenture estimates that by 2035, ai could boost average profitability rates by 38 percent and lead to an economic increase of $14 trillion. The same thing can be said even when discussing deep learning vs. As the name suggests, artificial intelligence can be loosely interpreted to mean incorporating human intelligence to machines.
