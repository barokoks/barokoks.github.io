What is artificial intelligence (AI)? FierceElectronics From fierceelectronics.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is the science of making machines capable of reasoning and learning new concepts. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. John mccarthy, one of the founding pillars of the ai discipline can be found saying, “it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.it is related to the similar task of using computers to. “artificial intelligence is an entity (or collective set of cooperative entities), able to receive inputs from the environment, interpret and learn from such inputs, and exhibit related and flexible behaviors and actions that help the entity achieve a particular goal or objective over a period of time.” * how we arrived at our definition:

<p>What Artificial Intelligence(AI) will look like in 100 years from now It is the type of ai that you see in movies where robots have conscious thoughts and act on their own motives. Science and technology — psychology. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. It is the science and engineering.</p>
