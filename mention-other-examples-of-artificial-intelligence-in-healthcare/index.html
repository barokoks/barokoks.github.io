Artificial Intelligence Applications Technical Review From technicalreview.in
Industry leaders still can’t agree on what the term “robot” embodies. Based data analytics platforms are being inducted to handle. For example, if the data incorporated in ai is mainly collected in academic medical centers, the developing ai systems will have less awareness about, and as a result, will treat less effectively, patients from populations that do not typically frequent academic medical centers.
