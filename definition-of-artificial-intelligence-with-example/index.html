<p>An Artificial Intelligence Definition for Beginners Nanalyze Artificial intelligence now affects productivity, employment, and competitive behavior in significant ways. For example, some groups view ai as either strong (generalized intelligence that can adapt to a variety of situations) or weak (specific intelligence designed to perform a particular task well). Reducing commute times is no simple problem to solve. This remains within the realm of science fiction, though.</p>
