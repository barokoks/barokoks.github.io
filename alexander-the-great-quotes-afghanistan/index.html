Mauidining Alexander The Great Afghan Quotes From mauidining.blogspot.com
“in my opinion, at least, the splendid achievements of alexander are the clearest possible proof that neither strength of body, nor noble blood, nor success in war even greater than alexander�s own. — reply to the suggestion by parmenion, before the battle of gaugamela, that he attack the persian camp during the night, reported in life of alexander by plutarch, as quoted in a history of greece to the death of alexander the great (1900) by john bagnell bury. Alexander’s campaign in afghanistan has become a mere footnote in his legacy—perhaps because it was the region where the great warlord saw the least success. May god keep you away from the venom of the cobra, the teeth of the tiger, and the revenge of the afghans.
