If you are someone who is enamored (!) by the apple ecosystem and also an audiophile, this review shall address your concerns regarding the tonal and technical proficiency of the airpods max.
Why the AirPods Max might be pitched at audiophiles Pickr From pickr.com.au
From the perspective of a regular person, not an audiophile The airpods max weigh in at 13.7 oz, so just 0.2 oz (1.5%) heavier than the drop panda though with the headband cover on the panda, these weigh 0.7 oz (5%) less than the drop. In the latest ‘faux outrage’, apple has produced an over the ear headphone, the airpods max, utilizing its array of computational audio and assembled with premium parts for $549. Sibilants like s and t sounds are slightly dulled.
