How to Build a Machine Learning Pipeline? Global tech Council From globaltechcouncil.org
It allows the sequence of steps to be specified, evaluated, and used as an atomic unit. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment. Moreover, the production system must run non. Pipelines should focus on machine learning tasks.
