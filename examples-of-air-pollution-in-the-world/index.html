Greenhouse gas pollution, the cause of climate change, affects the entire planet. This is what a lot of people think of when they think of very common forms of air pollution, and it can come from things that include nitrogen dioxide, pollution from particulates, ozone found at ground level, organic compounds that are considered volatile, sulphur dioxide, and, of course, carbon monoxide.
