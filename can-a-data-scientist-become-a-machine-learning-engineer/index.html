According to glassdoor, the average base pay for a machine learning engineer is more than $114,000 per year in the united states. A machine learning engineer designs, develops and optimizes certain types of artificially intelligent (ai) programs. In reality, these positions aren’t interchangeable and it may not be completely easy for a data engineer to become a data scientist. As you might have guessed, a data scientist�s workflow is extremely based on research and experimentation.
