Alan Turing the father of artificial intelligence The Translation Gate From thetranslationgate.com
He is often credited as the father of modern computer science. A discrete machine has a finite number of possible states. In turing (1937) a certain type of discrete machine was described. After touching on the validity of some of those reasons, turing presents two categories of machinery:

Alan Turing the father of artificial intelligence The Translation Gate.</h3><p>Computer pioneer and artificial intelligence (ai) theorist alan turing would have been 100 years old this saturday. Alan turing’s model of computation (1936) is explicated in terms of the potential operations of a human “computer”, and his famous test for intelligence (1950) is based on indistinguishability from human verbal behaviour. A discrete machine has a finite number of possible states. He remarked that there is little point in a ‘thinking machine’ looking, sounding or feeling like a human for the purpose of testing intelligence. On 12 november 1942, the mathematician alan turing arrived in new york, bound for washington dc and the headquarters of the us secret service, an organisation now known as the cia. In his lecture, turing presents the argument against a machine being “ intelligent ”:</p>
<p>As computers advanced from simple adding machines to devices able to do more complex calculations, fears about the intelligent machines and robots increased, and alan turing himself disclosed his own singularity predictions, writing, at some stage therefore we. It had an infinite memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape marked out into squares on each of which a symbol could be printed. Thus, the machine jumps from one state to the. <em>Alan Turing the father of artificial intelligence The Translation Gate</em>, He argues that to be able to code a program that fills up an even a moderate percentage of the storage capacity of the brain, it would take decades for an experienced group of programmers.</p>
