The term is usually applied to the members of an air force. He had trouble deciding which branch of engineering to. As an aeronautical engineer you’ll apply scientific, technological and mathematical principles to research, design, develop, maintain and test the performance of civil and military aircraft, including weapons, satellites and even space vehicles. The term aeronautics refers to the study of flight, originated in the early 19 century by sir george cayley (who invented the conventional configuration of the airplane).
