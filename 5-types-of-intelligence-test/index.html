MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES. IQ TESTS &amp; THE 9 TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE by From medium.com
The das is a test of cognitive ability that can be used with children aged 2 through 17 years. Although intelligence is not located in a specific part of the brain, it is more prevalent in some brain areas than others. Turing test the turing test was proposed in 1950 when computing was in its infancy. Many of these tests measure very limited aspects of intelligence (e.g., peabody picture vocabulary test, columbia mental maturity scale, ammons and ammons quick test), whereas others give a much broader view of a person�s intellectual skills, measuring general intelligence as well as more specific cognitive skills (e.g., the various wechsler scales).
