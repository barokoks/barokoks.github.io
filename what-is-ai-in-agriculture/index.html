<meta name="description" content="What Is Ai In Agriculture, According to a markets and markets report (2019), the agricultural ai market is presently valued at around $519 million and is projected to grow to $2.6 billion by 2025. In general, ai is a type of intelligence of computer systems with the help of which they can think on their own and can use their thinking for taking forward various processes without the help of human beings.
The 6 Most Amazing AI Advances in Agriculture From techopedia.com
Ai works by processing data input (everything from weather to soil to insects) and processing it incredibly fast so that farmers can make faster and better farming decisions. Agriculture is slowly becoming digital and ai in agriculture is emerging in three major categories, (i) agricultural robotics, (ii) soil and crop monitoring, and (iii) predictive analytics. Examples include yield prediction algorithms based on weather and historical yield data; Ai is redefining the traditional pattern of agriculture.
