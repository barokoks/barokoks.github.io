Machine learning (ml) is a subset of the computer science discipline of artificial intelligence (ai). The next generation 8 classification and prediction classification is the process of designing a set of models to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown. It is a subset of ai enabling a machine to learn from history data without programming explicitly. “a computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence if it can mimic human responses under specific.
