5 Reasons Why Artificial Intelligence Really Is Going To Change Our From bernardmarr.com
I think this is the best definition for machine learning, which is described as “machine imitating intelligent human behavior”.defining artificial intelligence in the context of the previous, “artificial intelligence” refers to simulating human intelligence processes by computers. Artificial intelligence is technology that behaves intelligently using skills associated with human intelligence, including the ability to perceive, learn, reason and act autonomously. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. Some respected scientists, successful it entrepreneurs and others have warned that ai may turn out be humanity’s downfall:
