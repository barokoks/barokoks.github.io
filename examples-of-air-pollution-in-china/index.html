The overall pollution in china fell further 10% between 2017 and 2018. Beijing’s population has swelled from 11 million to 16 million in just 7 years, and has doubled over the past century. But despite the lower pm2.5 pollution levels overall, 6 of 10 of the cities still saw slight rises in pm2.5 air pollution compared to last year, including: Chemical smog is obviously a big problem over there, quite literally.

China’s air pollution standard is already 300 percent more lenient than the who standard and more than twice as lenient as the u.s. Motorized vehicles are only one contributor to air pollution. Beijing’s population has swelled from 11 million to 16 million in just 7 years, and has doubled over the past century. People coming to china cannot distinguish between morning fog and coal smoke to form as a layer covering everything in some cities such as taiyuan, beijing or shanxi. In the last few years, china has made significant progress in reducing air pollution.</p>
<p>Coal burning is the biggest single source of air pollution in china, and burning of coal, has for the first time in this century declined in 2014 compared to 2013. Pollutants from factories in this area are often carried by winds into beijing and trapped there by mountains to the city’s north and west.
