<p>Engineering Design Engineering Design Process Scientific Method One of the core elements we consider when designing stem activities for our learners is the engineering design process, or edp. Designers, engineers, architects or scientists facilitate these steps to produce a solution to a specific problem. Team prototypes the new solution and tests it, repeating the process as necessary until an acceptable prototype has been developed. The engineering design.</p>
