The main reason is that there are so many parameters in a deep learning algorithm. In contrast, the term “deep learning” is a method of statistical learning that extracts features or attributes from raw data. Machine learning arises from the way data is delivered to the system.

<p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that train computer to do what comes naturally to humans: Deep learning utilises several layers of algorithms to find patterns and imitate human cognition. The data that gets represented in this case is also pretty different because deep learning makes use of ann (neural networks). <em>AI, machine learning, and deep learning The complete guide InfoWorld</em>, What is the difference between deep learning and (classical) machine learning?”.</p>
