What are the different types of artificial intelligence approaches? When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.

Machine learning is one of the primary approaches to artificial intelligence, but it has to be seen in the wider context of data science, which encompasses important areas such as the often underestimated and arduous work of data preparation on the one hand, and the fascinating field of data visualisation on the other.</p>
