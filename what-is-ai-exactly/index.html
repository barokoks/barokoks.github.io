Elaine rich (pictured), noted computer scientist and an author of artificial intelligence, offers a more specific definition: Ai is a technology that allows a machine, such as a video surveillance system, to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence to execute. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. In simpler terms, it is making computers think like humans.
