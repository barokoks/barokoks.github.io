Is Your Industry Ripe for Artificial Intelligence Disruption? IEEE From innovationatwork.ieee.org
In our experience, many custom software projects fall somewhere between the $50,000 and $250,000 mark to design and develop the application. Consumer internet companies employ dozens or hundreds of skilled engineers to build and maintain monolithic ai systems that create tremendous value — say, an online ad system that generates more. Unlike other app builders, we give you an accurate delivery time and price before you start. Fully automated solution — at least $25 million.
