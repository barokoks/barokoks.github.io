When compared with artificial intelligence, cognitive computing is an entirely different concept. The skilled use of reason (2) : Ai aims to produce the most accurate result or action by employing the best algorithm. Instead, a good ai system is the simply the best possible algorithms for solving a given problem — in the case of an autonomous car, avoiding collisions and staying on course.

<p>Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing Learn more about it here or here. First, artificial intelligence does not try to mimic human thought processes. Aren’t cognitive computing and ai the same thing? Cognitive computing tries to replicate how humans would solve problems while ai seeks to create new ways to solve problems that can potentially be better than humans. Cognitive computing and artificial intelligence have paved.</p>

<p>How Cognitive Computing and AI Drives Disruptive Innovation Analytics Cognitive computing and artificial intelligence have paved the way for facial identification, handwriting recognition, behavioral pattern determination, and more. On the other hand, cognitive computing simulates human thoughts or processes, and assists humans. Ai is used to augment human thinking and solving complicated problems.
