(PDF) ENGINEERING DEFINITION From researchgate.net
The action, work, or profession of an engineer. These steps aim to put a strong focus on collaboration and the value. The engineering design process is the process in which engineers solve problems. Machine design or mechanical design can be defined as the process by which resources or energy is converted into useful mechanical forms, or the mechanisms so as to obtain useful output from the machines in the desired form as per the needs of the human beings.
