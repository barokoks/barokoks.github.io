How Artificial Intelligence Assign Better Meaning with Voice NLP From onpassive.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) delivers business growth, helps improve decisions, and transforms businesses to become more intelligent, automated, and scalable. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. The more humanlike the desired outcome, the more data and processing power required.

<p>How Artificial Intelligence Assign Better Meaning with Voice NLP Artificial intelligence (ai) is a branch of computer science that enables computers and robots to perform tasks requiring intelligence. Artificial intelligence was first proposed by john mccarthy in 1956 in his first academic conference on the subje ct. Stated simply, ai is trying to make computers think and act like humans. In other words, artificial intelligence is algorithms that think.</p>
