Explain Communication among agents in Artificial Intelligence From slideshare.net
This communication is performed by the agents which work artificial intelligence and is thus known as artificial communication. On the internet, an intelligent agent (or simply an agent ) is a program that gathers information or performs some other service without your immediate presence and on some regular schedule. The action taken by an ai agent must be a rational action. The most popular acls are:

PPT Artificial Intelligence Chapter 24 . Communication among Agents.</h3><p>Agents can communicate and cooperate with other agents quickly. Agent assist is a part of conversation intelligence that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to provide suggestions to sales and support reps during live conversations with a prospect or customer. This is done through the sensors. The action taken by an ai agent must be a rational action. For learning from the environment and the surroundings, the agent must be able to observe and perceive information from the environment. It relieves the human user from monotonous clerical work.</p>
<p>The goal of artificial intelligence is to design an agent program which implements an agent function i.e., mapping from percepts into actions. The performance measure defines the criterion of success for an agent. Agent assist suggests the best response based on various factors like the content of the conversation and the attributes. <em>PPT Artificial Intelligence Chapter 24 .
