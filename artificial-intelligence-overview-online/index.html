The best way to learn Artificial Intelligence as a beginner! Learnbay From learnbay.io
Artificial intelligence (ai) is rapidly transforming our world. Intelligence is made up of • reasoning • learning • problem solving • perception • linguistic intelligence In other words, students of ai learn how to develop artificial intelligence applications that are inspired by the ways people learn, reason, and make decisions. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the way of making computing hardware and software think intelligently, in similarity to the manner humans use natural intelligence.
