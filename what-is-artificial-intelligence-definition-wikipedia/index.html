What is Artificial Intelligence? Is It Dangerous? Technologyness From technologyness.us
Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘who’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure.” The artificial intelligence is the next step in this process to make it more effective by applying logical, analytical, and more productive technologies into this effort. Intelligence refers to certain mental powers. “artificial intelligence, or ai, is the ability of a computer to act like a human being.

<p>PPT Prof. dr. Matjaž Gams MPŠ PowerPoint Presentation, free download It is also a field of study which tries to make computers smart. They work on their own without being encoded with commands. Ai manifests itself in everyday life via virtual assistants. “artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality. It has several applications, including software simulations and robotics.”.</p>
