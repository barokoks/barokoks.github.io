Top 6 Powerful Examples Of Artificial Intelligence Technology In Daily Life From nbpostgazette.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. They operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals Its goal is to enable the development of computers that are able to do things normally done by. Ai is not a single technology.
