Pathmind’s artificial intelligence wiki is a beginner’s guide to important topics in ai, machine learning, and deep learning. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.
