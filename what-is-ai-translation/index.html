AI Powered Translation Management System Stepes From stepes.com
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. An individual or a computer program that renders a text into another language is called a translator. Nida states that translation consist of reproducing in the receptor language the closest natural equivalence of the source language message, first in terms of meaning and secondly in terms of style.newmark in rudi hartono states that translation is rendering the meaning of a text into. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.
