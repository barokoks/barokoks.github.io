However important the issue under investigation psychologists need to remember that they have a duty to respect the rights and dignity of research participants. At its root, ethical competence resides in the human quest for knowledge and action that defines right and wrong behavior, the touchstone of ethics. Lechasseur, caux, dollÃ©, and legault define ethical knowledge as the knowledge constructed from a mix of philosophical, theoretical and practical knowledge, where pertinent contexts and individuals are taken into consideration. More generally, competence is the state or quality of being adequately or well qualified, having the ability to perform a specific role. This eventually forces them to lose confidence in the professionals who provide counseling services.</p>

Principles and standards from the american psychological associationï¿½s ethics code are reviewed and illustrated with clinical vignettes. Every professional should be able to and should willingly provide proof of competency in the field, that is achieved through education and work experience. <em>(PDF) Ethical Competence in Psychotherapy Termination</em>, In their article on multicultural competence, sue et al.</p>
