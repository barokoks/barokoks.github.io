The action that an agent does at a particular time is afunction of its inputs. A learning agent can be defined as an agent that, over time, improves its performance (which can be defined in different ways depending on the context) based on the interaction with the environment (or experience). The agent program is the implementation of the agent function, which maps the percept sequence to the corresponding actions. For example, a human can learn to ride a bicycle, even though, at birth, no human.

The part of the agent taking an action is called an actuator. It is an implementation of agent function in which agent function plays a vital role. Agents interact with environments through actuators and sensors the agent function describes what the agent does in all circumstances the performance measure evaluates the environment sequence a perfectly rational agent maximizes expected performance agent programs implement (some) agent functions</p>
