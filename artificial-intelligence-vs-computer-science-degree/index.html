Computer science is the study of how computers work, mostly from the theoretical and mathematical perspective. Students learn the theory behind topics such as programming or algorithms, as well as the skills and tools needed to do technical tasks. This should mean that you will have more time to apply to internships, do projects and complete research projects to become more competitive when seeking a job or graduate placements. Careers in this field tend to be more technical, whereas computer information systems careers are more practical.

Computer science concerns understanding, designing, implementing and using computing systems..</p>

<p>BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence with Computer Science University Computer science degrees generally aim to teach you the basic mathematical and scientific concepts behind computers and their programs. A computer science with artificial intelligence is a nice compromise between the two subjects. Artificial intelligence will use algorithms in computers to solve the problem, whereas data science will involve many different methods of statistics. Students learn the theory behind topics.</p>
