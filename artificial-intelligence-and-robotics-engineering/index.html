On the other hand, robotics brings artificial intelligence into the real world and deal with objects in real time. Artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics are digital technologies that will have significant impact on the development of humanity in the near future. They have raised fundamental questions about what we should do with these systems, what the systems themselves should do, what risks they involve, and how we can control these.</p>
