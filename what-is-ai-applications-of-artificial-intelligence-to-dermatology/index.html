Search your skin disease by uploading a smartphone picture from your smartphone or desktop. Ai has the potential to assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions and may have particular value at the interface between primary and secondary care. Most ai interventions in dermatology focus on differentiating between benign and malignant skin lesions with a particular emphasis on melanoma diagnosis 2. Artificial intelligence (ai) employs computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as speech recognition and visual perception.

The human ability to learn from examples and experiences has been transferred to a computer.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (ai) is frequently referred to as a facilitator for more precise, personalized, and safer health care. For this purpose, the neural network has been trained using a dermoscopic imaging database containing tens of thousands of examples that have confirmed diagnosis and assessment by dermatologists. The application was developed with the help of dermatologists to measure and assess skin conditions such as dark spots, discolorations, dryness, uneven tone, and fine wrinkles. <em>Artificial intelligence, machine learning and health systems</em>, However, achieving fair, reliable, and safe algorithms is necessary for clinical implementation.</p>
