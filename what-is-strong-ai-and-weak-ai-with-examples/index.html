Ai overview From slideshare.net
Often referred to as the best examples of weak ai, digital voice assistants such as siri and alexa are examples of weak ai that we rely on every day. The ai algorithms are built to accomplish specific tasks rather than possess full cognitive abilities like the human brain. The responses from weak ai all relate to information it received during programming. They know to detect information that’s similar to what they already.
