Deep Learning vs Neural Network What�s the Difference? smartboost From smartboost.com
Dl is the subset of ml. The major difference between deep learning vs machine learning is the way data is presented to the machine. Raise your hand if you’ve been caught in the confusion of differentiating artificial intelligence (ai) vs machine learning (ml) vs deep learning (dl)… bring down your hand, buddy, we can’t see it! The deep learning model learns to perform.
