How to build effective humanAI interaction Considerations for machine From towardsdatascience.com
Driving a car that operates on its own, stops at signals, maneuver difficult roads, and turns on its own can be a dream in the past, but it is a reality in the future. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Applied ai is the use of artificial intelligence to enhance and extend software applications. Animals and human beings are differentiated on the lines of reasoning power.
