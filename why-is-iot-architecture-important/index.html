The software architecture model also supports early design decisions, defines implementation constraints, and enables reuse. Large data pools are one of the many benefits the iot offers supply chain managers. Mass iot deployments may involve hundreds or thousands of devices, generating a collective mountain of data. An iot gateway can be either hardware or a software program and acts as a doorway for data headed in either direction.
