Contrary to ai, machine learning and deep learning have very clear definitions. The network has an input layer that accepts inputs from the data. Deep learning focuses even more narrowly on a subset of ml tools and techniques, and. Deep learning is what you find in background of most ml systems ( and also indirectly most ai systems).
