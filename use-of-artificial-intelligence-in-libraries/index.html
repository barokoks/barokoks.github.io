Artificial intelligence has become one of the main driving forces for the development of modern society, and it has also injected new vitality into the development of smart libraries. At stanford libraries we are considering the profound change ai can bring as power tools for scholarship, making our vast library collections discoverable, searchable, and analyzable in new ways. <em>FEATURE Libraries in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</em>, Ai is the study of mental faculties through the use of computational models.</p>
