MSc Applied Physics Masters Degree UK University of Strathclyde From strath.ac.uk
A gpa of 3.0 in all courses and of 3.0 in science and math courses is required to apply. Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. This versatile degree can lead to careers in engineering, education, and computer technology. Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.
