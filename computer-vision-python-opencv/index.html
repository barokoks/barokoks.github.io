You will learn and get exposed to a wide range of exciting topics like image &amp; video manipulation, image enhancement, filtering, edge detection, object detection and tracking, face detection and the opencv deep learning module. Opencv is a python library which is designed to solve computer vision problems. Last week i came up with an idea: Computer vision and machine learning with python, keras and opencv includes a demonstration of concepts with gesture recognition.
