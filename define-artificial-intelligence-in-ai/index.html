Artificial Intelligence Delivering Results Or Taking Over? From cxoinsightme.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The machine runs various random programs and algorithms to map the input raw sequence of input data to output. Some general definitions “artificial intelligence is a computerised system that exhibits behaviour that is commonly thought of as requiring intelligence.” (1) “artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by man.” (2) Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that can think like humans.

John mccarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ in the 1950s. Ai developers now work on improving, generalizing, and scaling up the intelligence currently found on smartphones. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally. The term artificial intelligence had. Ai is not a single technology.</p>
