While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm), it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally. This remains within the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem. It has several applications, including software simulations and robotics.
