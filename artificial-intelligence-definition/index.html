<p>Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent. The idea of machines operating like human beings began to be the Experience.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence Definition, Types, Examples, Technologies by What does artificial intelligence (ai) mean? Ai, which stands for artificial intelligence, is a branch of computer science that develops machine systems capable of demonstrating behaviors linked to human intelligence. Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human beings) ‘who’ is capable of acquiring and. Ai is not a single technology. This.</p>
