Machine Learning Algorithms Top 5 Machine Learning Algorithms Edureka From edureka.co
Learning can be broadly classified into three categories, as mentioned below, based on the nature of the learning data and interaction between the learner and the environment. There are two main types of machine learning algorithms. The study of classification in statistics is vast, and there are several types of classification algorithms you can use depending on the dataset you’re working with. Regardless of the algorithm, it can generally be categorized as one of four categories:
