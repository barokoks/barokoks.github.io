The turing test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence ( ai) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The turing test is legendary in the field of artificial intelligence. A renowned figure of modern computer science, alan turing often described and describes the turing test, an initiative that led to the introduction of artificial intelligence to the world, after decoding the encryption of german enigma machines during world war ii.

<p>Pin on guadalupe pt sal dunes beach&hellip; Instead of trying to define the terms “machine” and “think,” turing outlines a different method for answering this question derived from a victorian parlor amusement called the imitation game. Turing test in ai in 1950, alan turing introduced a test to check whether a machine can think like a human or not, this test is known as the turing test..</p>
