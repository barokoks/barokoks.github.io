What is Artificial Intelligence? News Open Sourced Workplace From opensourcedworkplace.com
Ai is not a single technology. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception. Venture capitalist frank chen provides a good overview of how to distinguish between them, noting: Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine or computer program to make decisions rather than simply performing a task based on direct human instruction.

While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm),  it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
