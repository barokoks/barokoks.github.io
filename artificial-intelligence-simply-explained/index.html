This remains within the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem. Strong ai, or artificial general intelligence (agi), is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from westworld, ex_machina, or i, robot. Basically, ai is the ability of a machine or computer program to think and learn. “intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.” an agent is quite simply an entity that can.
