How Different Types of Artificial Intelligence can Add Value to Business? From quytech.com
Weak or artificial narrow intelligence (ani) weak or narrow ai is a type of ai which performs assigned tasks using intelligence. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Weak ai or narrow ai: By far the most advanced form of ai.
