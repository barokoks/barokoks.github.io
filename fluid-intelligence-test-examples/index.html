<p>Pin on WISCIV and WISCV Practice Questions and Tips At the individual level, it becomes important to distinguish between physical and social causes of cognitive competence, and between fluid and crystallized intelligence (gc and gf). Examples of tasks that measure fluid intelligence include figure classifications, figural analyses, number and letter series, matrices, and paired associates.
