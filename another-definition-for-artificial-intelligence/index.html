Intentional Bias Is Another Way Artificial Intelligence Could Hurt Us.</h3><p>It is the process of learning by processing and analyzing the input data by several methods until the machine discovers the single desirable output. Artificial intelligence encapsulates a broad set of computer science for perception, logic and learning. Ai programs use data collected from different interactions to improve the way they mimic humans in order to perform tasks such as learning, planning, knowledge. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. Artificial intelligence refers to any computer with cognitive abilities similar to a human brain, such as learning and reasoning. Yes, some ai is modeled to simulate human intelligence, but that’s what it is:</p>
