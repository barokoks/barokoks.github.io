Iq tests are calibrated to give people with average intelligence a score of 100, with numbers above and below this following a gaussian curve (see chart). Intelligence quotient is the ability of a person to think intellectually and logically. Originally, the letters iq stood for intelligence quotient, and a “quotient” is precisely what the scores represented. Although the process has changed slightly, the underlying basis of the procedure used to determine iq is first administering a test to determine a person’s mental age or how much they know compared to others their same age.
