Proficiency (measured on the vertical axis) usually increases with increased experience (the horizontal axis), that is to say, the more someone performs a task, the better their performance at the task.

This pattern of decrease in the amount learnt as the period of learning increases is known as the principle of diminishing returns. This revival is called the end spurt. Rapid decline in transformation cost. Awareness and competence, yielding 4 distinct stages, and two different outcomes.</p>
