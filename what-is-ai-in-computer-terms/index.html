Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training). The encyclopedia britannica states, “artificial intelligence (ai), the ability. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent.

Machine learning algorithms automatically learn. The term “intelligence” is, of course, the subject of both. The term “artificial intelligence” refers to a specific field of computer science that. Computer software that mimics aspects of human intelligence.</p>

<p>What is the current role of Artificial Intelligence in digital Machine learning algorithms automatically learn. The starting point is easy. Specific applications of ai include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. Stated simply, ai is trying to make computers think and act like humans. Today, the term mostly means these intelligent machines:</p>
