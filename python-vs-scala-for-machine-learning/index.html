Pyspark is more popular because python is the most popular language in the data community. No such problem is seen in scala. In the united states, the average salary for a professional who is thoroughly trained in scala is $117,698 per annum while, it is $92,177 for professionals possessing python skills.data scientists with python skills can earn an average of $98,000 in the us, and data engineers proficient in scala can earn an average salary of $100,000, which is not as. This makes it an easy system to start with and scale up to big data processing or incredibly large scale.

You can almost do anything in both python and scala, but you probably will take more time with scala than with python even if scala is less verbose than java. Scala is frequently over 10 times faster than python. Python is simple and incredibly readable since closely resembles the english language. So while it is worth thinking about each language�s available tools for large scale problems, the ml algorithms used may dominate performance.</p>
<p>Python is always slower than scala,if there is huge processing logic in usecase scala will definitely offer better performance. You can almost do anything in both python and scala, but you probably will take more time with scala than with python even if scala is less verbose than java.
