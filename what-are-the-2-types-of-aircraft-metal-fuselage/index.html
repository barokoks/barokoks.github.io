<p>Aircraft Structures Aircraft Systems The fuselage, or body of the airplane, is a long hollow tube which holds all the pieces of an airplane together. Older types of aircraft design utilized an open truss structure constructed of wood, steel, or aluminum tubing. In multiengine aircraft, the engines may be either in the fuselage, attached to the fuselage, or suspended from the wing structure. The.</p>

Boeing 737 carries passengers and cargo in the fuselage This type of construction was called the monocoque, which is a french term for single shell (or hull). �monocoque� is a french word meaning �single shell�. These metals also resist corrosion better than both aluminum and steel. However, the production of airplanes made from titanium is very costly, which largely prohibits wide commercial use of most titanium airplanes.</p>
