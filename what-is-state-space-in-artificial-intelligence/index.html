A set of goal states, often specified as a boolean function, goal(s), that is true when s is a goal state; Ai problem can be represented as a well formed set of possible. These correspond to the steps or moves in a problem. In the k knight problem, the legal actions are moving parallel.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is the weapon of the next Cold War State space model (ssm) refers to a class of probabilistic graphical model (koller and friedman, 2009) that describes the probabilistic dependence between the latent state variable and the observed measurement. An action function that, given a state and an action, returns a new state; It is very useful in ai because of it provides a set of all possible states,.</p>
