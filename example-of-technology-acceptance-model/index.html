Its originators reasoned that the key to increasing use was to first increase acceptance of it, which could be assessed by asking individuals about their future intentions to use the it. The technology acceptance model is an information systems theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. Behavioral intention is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The technology acceptance model proposes that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness predict the acceptance of information technology. In (tam) the main determinants of user’s acceptance of new technology are perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (peou) (davis, 1989).</p>
<p>Based on the theory of reasoned action, davis ( 1986 ) developed the technology acceptance model which deals more specifically with the prediction of the acceptability of an information system. Describes the degree to which a person believes that their work performance can be increased by using the system, for example whether the system can help them to complete a task more quickly.
