Genetic factors can increase the risk of getting infected by lung diseases such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Smoking can reduce the capacity of the lungs to respire thereby making them more vulnerable to respiratory disorders. Diseases caused by pollution, lead to the chronic illness and deaths of about 8.4 million people each year.however, pollution receives a fraction of the interest from the global community.
