Physics Vs Electrical Engineering How to Pick the Right Major YouTube From youtube.com
Physics majors are strong problem solvers who can apply their skills to a variety of fields. Colleges in the united states reported awarding 941 degrees in this year alone. A pure physics degree really only lends itself to research, and most engineers go into industry. Good for motivated students who are driven to a specific field of interest, to define their own research, and want a strong physics background.

Engineering physics just sets you up to be more suited to doing analysis, so it�s slightly less real world and slightly more theoretical. You�ll learn more theory than any practicing engineer would ever need, but this can be helpful.</p>
