Observing a person’s behavior and adding it to a database of similar behaviors from other persons given a similar set of circumstances, goals, resources, and environmental conditions. The narrow ai cannot function beyond what is assigned to the system. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. Specific applications of ai include expert systems , natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
