The future of artificial intelligence two experts disagree From theconversation.com
Artificial intelligence and the future of humans experts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in ai will affect what it means to be human, to. Ai’s potential for good is vast. Ai will enable an efficient battle against the rising cyberattacks and crimes. Artificial intelligence holds a lot of magnitudes in that its development could save more lives around the world as technology becomes more advanced.

Artificial intelligence and the future of humans experts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in ai will affect what it means to be human, to. The united states national science and technology’s subcommittee on machine learning and artificial intelligence delivered a report to the white house on ai and employment in 2016, acknowledging job loss but also emphasising potential new careers and opportunities. Ai programs can take over repetitive work so humans can focus on other things, substantially improving productivity. Since artificial intelligence is a collaboration of human intelligence and the dexterity/power of the machine, these machines are more efficient than the humans and have the capability to overthrow us and emerge as superbeings of the future.</p>

Artificial intelligence is the best way forward for banking because it brings the facility of advanced data analytics to combat fraudulent transactions and.
