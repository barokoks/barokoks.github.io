The long history of ai vs. Cognitive computing advocates say that “cognitive assistants” are tools that handle volumes of data and exhaustive rounds of analytics, but humans remain firmly in. While on the other hand — cognitive computing is the individual technologies that perform specific tasks that facilitate human intelligence. Cognitive computing systems are reasoning, analysing and memorizing systems that collaborate with humans to help them make better decisions.

<p>Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing Wikipedia defines cognitive computing platforms as describes technology platforms that, broadly speaking, are based on the scientific disciplines of artificial intelligence and signal processing. In other words, ai is applied to automate processes while cognitive computing is for augmenting human capabilities. So, what is the difference between artificial intelligence and cognitive computing?
