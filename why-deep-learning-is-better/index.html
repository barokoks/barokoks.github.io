<h3 id="3-practical-thoughts-on-why-deep-learning-performs-so-well-deep-double-descent">3 practical thoughts on why deep learning performs so well. Deep Double Descent.</h3><p>Prevent bias in deep learning with multiple approaches like introducing more diversity in the field; These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. If your data are images, create randomly modified versions of existing images. This is because deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to understand it. A theory that goes beyond describing what individual neurons do, and explains the emergent behavior of the entire network. Its ability to learn unsupervised drives continuous improvement in accuracy and outcomes.</p>
<p>A neural network which better approximate the (ideal and purely hypothetical) mathematical function introduced above. If you can’t reasonably get more data, you can invent more data. Naturally handles the recursivity of human language. <em>Deep Double Descent</em>, The financial industry is relying more and more on deep learning to deliver stock price predictions and execute trades at the right time.</p>
