What is Artificial Intelligence? How Does AI Work, Applications and Future? From mygreatlearning.com
The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. John mccarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ in the 1950s. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. Today, the term artificial intelligence (ai) is thrown around rather generously.
