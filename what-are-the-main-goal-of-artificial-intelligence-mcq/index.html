<p>Will Artificial Intelligence Rules The Realm Of Digital Marketing E.g., software program, expert system, heuristic search. No more human intervention for feeding data to machines. To implement human intelligence in machines − creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans. Now that we have understood the different components of artificial intelligence and the different types of learning that it uses, we can confidently say that ai is.</p>
