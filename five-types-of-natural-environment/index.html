For instance, the natural environment of any part of the earth’s surface can be classified into the following sixteen elements. Natural environments include plants, trees edible gardens, sand, rocks, mud, water and other elements from nature. Aquatic, grassland, forest, desert, and tundra, though some of these biomes can be further divided into more specific categories, such as. When this is done, the whole matter is easy to understand.
