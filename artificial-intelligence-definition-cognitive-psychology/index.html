In its early years, the ai was created to emulate the functioning of the mind and the brain in a computer software. We have all lived through childhood and adolescence as adults, and we share maturational. Ai is like many human inventions with its risks and benefits two sides of a janus head. Ai is the field devoted to building artifacts that are intelligent, where ‘intelligent’ is operationalized through intelligence tests (such as the wechsler adult intelligence scale), and other tests of mental ability (including, e.g., tests of mechanical ability, creativity, and so on).
