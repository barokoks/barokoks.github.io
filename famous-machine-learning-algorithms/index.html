Where one is considered being independent variable and the other is a dependent one. Pca is an unsupervised method to understand the global properties of a dataset consisting of vectors. The value of each feature in svm is same as that of specific. A google search engine, for example, is an algorithm that accepts a search query as input and searches its database for items that match the words in the query.
