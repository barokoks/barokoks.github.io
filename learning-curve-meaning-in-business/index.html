When you invest the time into getting new knowledge to last, you can achieve the lasting behavior change and positive impact you’re after. Jumping from one plateau to another is called organization of learning. This paper explores the implications of the learning curve for competitive strategy under a range of assumptions regarding competition and the nature of the learning process. Some learning curves can be larger because the job is difficult or contains many different steps or levels to complete.
