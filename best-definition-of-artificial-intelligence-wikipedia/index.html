What is Artificial Intelligence? Is It Dangerous? Technologyness From technologyness.us
The ability of ai to conceive and execute appropriate actions that have the best possibility of achieving a certain objective is its ideal attribute. It is the phenomenon of one’s capacity to deploy, figure out, read, and. While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm), it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. This remains within the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem.
