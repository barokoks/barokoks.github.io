Enigma (Alan Turing The Enigma) by Andrew Hodges, KRP Yayıncılık From pinterest.com
While the author divides the text into two parts, it actually reads like a play in four acts. The enigma to anyone who wants to learn more about the life of this underappreciated, truly remarkable man, someone who has been largely forgotten by history outside of his native country and who was oppressed during his lifetime for being who he was. Hodges cleverly introduces each chapter of alan turing with an excerpt from whitman’s leaves of grass (1855), thus suffusing the biography with a poetic beauty that complements and enhances the author’s engaging prose. And not that there aren’t interesting ideas, there are, in abundance;
