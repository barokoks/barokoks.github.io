<p>Supervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning 7 Valuable Differences Deep learning requires an already existing data set to learn while reinforcement learning does not need a current data set to learn. In traditional reinforcement learning the problem spaces were very limited and the possible states in an environment were only few. Deep learning and reinforcement learning are both systems that learn autonomously. The agent learns to achieve a goal.</p>

The application of deep learning is more often on recognition and area reduction tasks while reinforcement learning is usually linked with environment interaction with optimal control. Deep learning is also known as hierarchical learning or deep structured. Deep learning.</p>

While reinforcement learning is dynamically learning by adjusting actions based in continuous feedback. Deep reinforcement learning is a sub class of reinforcement learning. What makes deep learning and reinforcement learning functions interesting is they enable a computer to develop rules on its own to solve problems. Deep learning requires an already existing data set to learn while reinforcement learning does not need a current data set to learn.
