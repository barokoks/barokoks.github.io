Artificial Intelligence System Designs Drugs From Scratch Research From rdworldonline.com
A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. In the simplest terms, ai which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. This is very different from how intelligence agencies (cia &amp; co.) usually use it. The goal of ai is to create systems that can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence.
