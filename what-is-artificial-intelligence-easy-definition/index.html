<p>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? A simple Explanation Ritambhar Das Artificial intelligence (ai) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. Of course, this shifts the definition problem to “what is intelligence?” Artificial intelligence (ai) in general terms, ai refers to a broad field of science encompassing not only computer science but also psychology, philosophy, linguistics and other areas. Ai (artificial intelligence) is a machine’s ability to.</p>
