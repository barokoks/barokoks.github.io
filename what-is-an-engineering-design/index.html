ENGINEERING DESIGN Hedobec™ From hedobec.com
Design in mechanical engineering refers to creating, designing and building new machines that improve the efficiency of existing ones. What makes a good design engineer? In civil engineering, designing means finding out the dimension of a structural member and amount of other materials (reinforcement, prestressing etc.) which will be sufficient to withstand diifferent types of loads and forces applied on that member, at.
