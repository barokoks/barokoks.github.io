They improve from experience, even. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence (ai) discipline geared toward the technological development of human knowledge. Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: “machine learning is defined as the study of computer programs that leverage algorithms and statistical models to learn through inference and patterns without being explicitly programed.
