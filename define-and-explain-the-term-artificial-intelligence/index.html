Definition of Artificial Intelligence and How does it Works DefiningAI.</h3><p>The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. Achieving this end requires three key components: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based. Artificial intelligence (ai) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm),  it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.</p>
