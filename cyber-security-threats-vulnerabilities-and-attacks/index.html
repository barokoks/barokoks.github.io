The attacker’s motives may include information theft, financial gain, espionage, or sabotage. The cybersecurity threats landscape is growing and increasing its negative impacts on companies, with cybercrime causing nearly $1 trillion in damage in 2020, according to “the hidden costs of cybercrime” report by mcafee. A cyber attack is an intentional and malicious effort by an organization or an individual to breach the systems of another organization or individual. By and large, potential threats that include data breaches, computer virus es, malware, and denial of service attacks disrupt digital life.
