Cognitive Computing and Artificial Intelligence — how do they relate From blog.arbitusa.com
Historically speaking, philosophy of mind is the oldest academic field. Sufficient programming experience in python or other ai programming languages; The main motivation behind the aic events lies in the fact that, from a historical standpoint (and due to the previous influences of the cybernetics in the study of natural and artificial systems), research in artificial intelligence (ai) has been based on a strong collaboration with cognitive science disciplines. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous.
