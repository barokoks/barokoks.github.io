Currently, there is no such system exist which could come under general ai and can perform any task as perfect. Artificial intelligence nanodegree programs (udacity) 7. Narrow ai, or applied ai, is a more realistic construct that programs and enables computers to perform specific tasks at least as well as a human could perform them. Artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning are often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of the broader category of ai.
