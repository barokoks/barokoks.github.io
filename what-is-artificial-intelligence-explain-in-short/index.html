Artificial Intelligence(AI) Intellicept From intellicept.com
The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally. Ai is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process.

<p>A Very Short History of Artificial Intelligence AI Artificial What does artificial intelligence (ai) mean? Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent. This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence.</p>
