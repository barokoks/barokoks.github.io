<p>What is Machine Learning? Machine learning artificial intelligence “in just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of ai are done,” said mit sloan professor. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. Machine learning is specific, not general, which means it.</p>

<p>Machine Learning explainedWhat is machine learningMachine learning Initially, the model is fed parameter data for which the answer is. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed. Broadly speaking, machine learning uses computer programs to identify patterns across thousands or even millions of data points..</p>
