That’s because, as an artificial intelligence specialist, you develop software and computers that “think” like a human brain. In contrast with strong ai, weak ai is any technology developed that is capable of accomplishing intelligent tasks but lacks the overarching purpose of general intelligence. Furthermore, the crucial weaknesses.</p>
