What is artificial intelligence (AI)? FierceElectronics From fierceelectronics.com
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but ai does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. So let�s take a look at ai and what it. Artificial intelligence (ai) can be daunting for many, let alone for children.
