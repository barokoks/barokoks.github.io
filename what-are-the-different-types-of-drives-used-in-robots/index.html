What are the Different Types of Industrial Robots and Their From processsolutions.com
Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators are generally suited to driving prismatic joints since they produce linear motion directly. The same can be said for robots. The twisting joints are also referred to. There are literally dozens of types of electric motors but i will discuss the most common types used in amateur robotics.

A robot will require a drive system for moving their arm, wrist, and body. Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators are generally suited to driving prismatic joints since they produce linear motion directly.
