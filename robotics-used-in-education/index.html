Ai can help get rid of boundaries and make learning easily accessible for everyone. In fact, students love to partake in activities in which they have full control, something that is possible with robotics. According to educational expert sir anthony seldon , within the next ten years teaching robots will be able to read children’s facial expressions, and maybe even their brains , to analyze and adapt to how. Educational robotics — or pedagogical robotics — is a discipline designed to introduce students to robotics and programming interactively from a very early age.

<p>Why Robotics should be included in STEM education Children and young students find it funny and engaging because they feel free to interact directly with both electrical and mechanical processes and procedures. There are students who can’t attend school in person or who, for various reasons, skipped school years. Besides, they get to make something that does what they want it to do. Robots are increasingly being used.</p>
