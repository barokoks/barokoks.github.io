A conceptual problem can be included in multiple games (cp b is included in vg b, c, and d) and can have multiple solutions (ai a and d are two different solutions for cp a). These algorithms are used to divide the subjected variable into different classes and then predict the class for a given input. <em>Decision Intelligence Indepth Guide for businesses [2020]</em>, The only knowledge we need to provide is the rules, legal moves and the conditions of winning or losing the game.</p>
