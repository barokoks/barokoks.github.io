“when this wave of expansion matures, the technology will run up against a new boundary of synthesis, creativity, and strategic thinking. A 2017 world robotics report estimates that entertainment robots (toys or hobby robots) sold 2.5 million units in 2017, bringing in a revenue of $1.1 billion. Perhaps artificial intelligence and robotics are the most important. As technologies such as robotic process automation (rpa) mature, an increasing amount of the work done by people will be transferred to bots and algorithms.

An analysis we conducted of several hundred ai use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in annual value, or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques (exhibit 1). It is sometimes referred to as software robotics. 6 things people.</p>
