Excited for the Apple AirPods 3? You may have to wait a little longer From todaynewspost.com
The airpods 2 are perfectly fine, too, if you don’t care for the new design, spatial audio, or wireless charging case. The airpods 3 battery life is six hours at a full charge — a full hour better than the airpods. They sound better, have ipx4 water resistance, and support spatial audio with head tracking. Even with the main structure of airpods 3 being bigger, the lack of ear tips makes them feel more comfortable and secure in people’s ears.
