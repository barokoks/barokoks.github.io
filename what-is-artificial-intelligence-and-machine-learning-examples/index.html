Machine learning is how a computer system develops its intelligence. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the terms of computer science. Artificial intelligence examples include face id, the search algorithm, and recommendation algorithm, among others. This article discusses some points on the basis of which we can differentiate between these two terms. Ml cannot rediscover calculus, for instance.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is the most common learning method in the field of artificial intelligence. So, ai is the tool that helps data science get results and solutions for specific problems.
