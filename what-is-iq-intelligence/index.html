Actually, the intelligence quotient is defined as 100 times the mental age (ma) divided by the chronological age (ca).
Emotional Intelligence From performancedevelopment.com.au
David wechsler, who published the scale in 1955, viewed intelligence as “the global capacity of a person to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment” (as cited in wikipedia). The average score of this test is 100 points. 2.intelligence determines the overall personality and specialization of a person whereas iq concentrates on only study. The wechsler intelligence scale, which has both adult and child versions, is the most commonly used iq test.
