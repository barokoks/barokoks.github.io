Machine Learning Engineer vs Data Scientist Battle of Future Careers From in.springboard.com
Some might see an overlap in their roles and responsibilities as well. A data scientist collects, processes and makes meaning out of data. Data scientist earns the lowest because he or she is the least independent. A data scientist is expected to have a deep understanding of stats/math and ml/ai, and is often the person who creates the tools used by ml engineers.
