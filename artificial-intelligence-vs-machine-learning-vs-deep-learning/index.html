Ai and machine learning are often used interchangeably, especially in the realm of big data. Hi all, welcome to we the demigods motivational. Singkatnya deep learning adalah bagian dari machine learning, dan machine learning adalah bagian dari artificial intelligence yang merupakan istilah umum untuk setiap program komputer yang melakukan. Deep learning, is just a type of machine learning, inspired by the structure of the human brain.
