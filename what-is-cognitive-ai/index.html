Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing From blog.athenagt.com
Ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. It is related to the similar task of using computers to. Cognitive automation, or also called intelligent, or ai process automation is the smart way of automation. Ai is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process.
