Artificial intelligence is often talked about in conjunction with machine learning or deep learning and big data. Imagine a human anatomy database including these symbolic entities: It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. “artificial intelligence is defined as the branch of science and technology that [is] concerned with the study of software and hardware to provide machines the ability to learn insights from data and [the] environment and the ability to adapt in changing situation[s] with high precision, accuracy and speed.”―amit ray, compassionate.
