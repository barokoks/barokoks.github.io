Why a Marriage Between the Cloud and of Things Is Inevitable From pinterest.com
Cloud computing refers to the on demand availability of computing resources over internet. Protocols must be put in place to offer a controlled mechanism of data receiving and storing. Let’s talk about the features of iot platforms and the technologies on which these cloud solutions are based. This is where big data plays an important role.
