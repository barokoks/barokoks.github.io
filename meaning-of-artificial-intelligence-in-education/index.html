Definition of Artificial Intelligence and How does it Works DefiningAI From definingai.com
The use of artificial intelligence in education today is not embodied, as the roboticists call it. So artificial intelligence improves the learning experience in this modern era where this is a short attention span. While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm), it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Ai has the power to optimize both learning and teaching, helping the education sector evolve to better benefit students and teachers alike.
