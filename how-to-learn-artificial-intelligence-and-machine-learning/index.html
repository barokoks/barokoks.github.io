How Healthcare Can Prep for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning From healthitanalytics.com
In this step, you get to look for the data you will use for your machine learning algorithm. Natural language processing is a field of machine learning in which machines learn to understand natural language as spoken and written by humans, instead of the data and numbers normally used to program computers. Machine learning can be achieved by way of giving laptop examples in the form of algorithms. Computers are able to simulate human behavior through artificial intelligence.artificial intelligence includes a subset called machine learning which allows machines to find patterns in existing data without requiring that they code the information.in artificial intelligence, a complex problem can be solved using a smart computer system.
