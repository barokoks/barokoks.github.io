<p>Production Choices and Costs The Short Run It says that, at early stages of production, if we increase 1 production variable and the rest of the things remain the same, the product total production may increase. Within marginal productivity, the output is assumed to change on the basis of this change in a single unit of labor while all other factors remain constant. Meaning of marginal productivity.</p>
