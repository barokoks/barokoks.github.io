The growing need for artificial intelligence management Canto From canto.com
Artificial intelligence refers to the ability of software to perform manipulations similar to actions carried out under the control of the human brain. Consistent with rapid technological development and the replacement of human organization, ai may indeed compel management to rethink. How artificial intelligence is redefining the role of manager. Ai is a computer science that allows machines to understand data and make or propose judgments based on that data.
