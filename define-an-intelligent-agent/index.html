<p>(PDF) A first course in Artificial Intelligence and Agent Technology By definition, an intelligent agent is anything that can make decisions about how to react or respond based on how it perceives its environment and its experiences. It carries out an action with the best outcome after considering past and current percepts (agentâs perceptual inputs at a given instance). Agents are designed to make computing easier.
