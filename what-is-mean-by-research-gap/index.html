Research Gap Meaning From dontblinkphotoz.blogspot.com
A research gap may be further developed, such as through stakeholder engagement in prioritization, into research needs. Research gaps simply means what is there (what exists) and what needs to be done to answer the research question of your interest. Research gaps can be identified by citation analysis, systematic reviews and in the introduction section of research articles and finally in the discussions and future research sections in research papers or journals which researchers have already published. A research gap is a question or a problem that has not been answered by any of the existing studies or research within your field.
