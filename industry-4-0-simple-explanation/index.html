To many stakeholders, industry 4.0 is not an upgrade of the third revolution but an entirely new revolution with a new experience. This transition is so compelling that it is being called industry 4.0 to represent the fourth revolution that has occurred in manufacturing. As a result of the support of smart machines that keep getting smarter as they get access to more data, our factories will become more efficient and productive and less wasteful. Here is fourth industrial revolution (4ir) or industry 4.0 explained.
