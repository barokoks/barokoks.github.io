Compressed Air Duties for Breathing Air Direct Air From directair.co.uk
Aeroplanes employe following type of compressor. A 500 cfm reciprocating compressor has a loading and unloading period of 5 seconds and 20 seconds respectively during a compressed air leakage test. Tech b says an inlet pressure regulating valve located in the compressor intake port will limit air pressure to approximately 20 psi (138 kpa) if supplied with turbocharged air. Operators on the plant floor might think of compressed air as a free commodity and, using their creativity, think of all sorts of things to do with it.
