Research Gap Meaning From dontblinkphotoz.blogspot.com
Several authors have sought to characterise research gaps, describing the various forms they can take, whether considered from the perspective of objectively identifiable existing gaps in research (gap finding) or as opportunities to construct new “gaps” (gap creation). When a researcher is conducting research, he/she aims at bridging the gap. It’s a gap in the knowledge of the scientists in the field of research of your study. Gap analysis is an assessment tool that measures the difference between the current result and the expected result.it is an diagnostic tool that identifies the current requirements to achieve the goal.
