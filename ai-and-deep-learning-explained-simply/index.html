What is deep learning? TechTalks From bdtechtalks.com
This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to. With the help of ai, professionals are analyzing data to make predictions in many areas, including healthcare diagnoses and treatment plans, supply chains, and even meteorology and air travel. This means that ai is a field that encompasses.
