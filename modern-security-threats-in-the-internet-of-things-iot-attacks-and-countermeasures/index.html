This category of attacks can be considered as. The internet of things (iot), is commonly defined as network of physical objects that can sense, collect, analyse, and send data using internet protocols. The internet of things (iot) has emerged as a technology capable of connecting heterogeneous nodes/objects, such as people, devices, infrastructure, and makes our daily lives simpler, safer, and fruitful. The book explores modern sensor technologies while also discussing security issues, which is the dominant factor for many types of internet of things (iot) applications.
