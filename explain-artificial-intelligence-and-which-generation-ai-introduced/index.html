If visual inspection slows the production process. The history of artificial intelligence ( ai) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. Because of this, it is essential to explain it easily using concrete examples which they can understand.
