What is of Things (IoT) &amp; how it works? From eliasgjacob.blogspot.com
The internet of things(iot) describes the network that is embedded with the software, sensors, etc. The one caveat is that authoritarian government could use enhanced surveillance to abuse human rights, but as the internet of things examples below will show, the benefits far outweigh the potential for abuse in the hands of a few dictators. A smart home usually consists of a central control unit (maybe physical or on cloud) which reads information from every type of sensor spread throughout the home. Shops that sell iot products.
