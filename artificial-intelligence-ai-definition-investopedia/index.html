<meta name="description" content="Artificial Intelligence (Ai) Definition – Investopedia, Artificial intelligence (ai) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being.
Signal Processing — Engine Sound Detection by data4help From becominghuman.ai
The term artificial intelligence was first coined in 1956 by john mccarthy, a computer scientist working on making computers intelligent. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the simulation of human intelligence in computers, and they are trained to think and act in the same way as humans do. The benchmark for ai is the human level concerning in teams of reasoning, speech, and vision. Simply put, any machine or computer that performs tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence qualifies as ai.
