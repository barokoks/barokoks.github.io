<p>7 Different Types of Artificial Intelligence 15 real world applications of artificial intelligence. Rational agents are different from omniscient agents because a rational agent tries to get the best possible outcome with the current perception, which leads to imperfection. Let us discuss four basic kinds of agent programs, used in almost all intelligent systems: These agents manipulate knowledge to infer new things at âknowledge levelâ. Agents.</p>

(see additional types of ai below.) Accessible / inaccessible â if the agentâs sensory apparatus can have access to the complete state of the environment, then the environment is accessible to that agent. Artificial general intelligence (agi), also known as strong ai or deep ai, refers to the idea of a machine with general intelligence that can learn and apply its intelligence to solve every problem. This type of ai has no memory power, so they lack the capability to use previously gained information/experience to obtain better results. There are 5 main categories of intelligent agents. The simplest kind of agent is the simple reflex agent.</p>
