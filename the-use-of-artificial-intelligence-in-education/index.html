The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Education Neuromation Medium From medium.com
Artificial intelligence can know what would be the best mode of delivering the content and at what pace and how deep. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing ai identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of ai in administration, instruction, and learning. And, it incorporates complex tasks readily and accelerates the learning task too. Artificial intelligence (ai) has the ability to automate even the most monotonous jobs, such as administrative labor, grading papers, measuring learning patterns, and responding to general questions.
