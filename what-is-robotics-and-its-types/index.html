Robotics is the branch of engineering, science &amp; technology that helps to study, design, develop, and construct robots or machines to reduce human efforts. Each has specific elements (speed, size, workspace) making them ideal for certain applications. The voyager and pioneer spacecraft are now traveling beyond our solar system. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.

What Are the Different Types of Robots? (with pictures).</h3><p>While the overall world of robotics is expanding, a robot has some consistent characteristics: The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. These robots contain sensor based circuits &amp; can perform multiple tasks. A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. It�s a robot whose arms have concurrent prismatic or rotary joints.</p>
<p>The voyager and pioneer spacecraft now traveling outside earth�s solar system are also robots. A robot is a programmable mechanical device that can perform tasks and interact with its environment, without the aid of human interaction. It is a bimanual and underwater humanoid robot that stanford robotics labs created to explore the coral reefs. <em>What Are the Different Types of Robots?
