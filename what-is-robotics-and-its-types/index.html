Robotics is the branch of engineering, science &amp; technology that helps to study, design, develop, and construct robots or machines to reduce human efforts. Each has specific elements (speed, size, workspace) making them ideal for certain applications. The voyager and pioneer spacecraft are now traveling beyond our solar system. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.

Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. These robots contain sensor based circuits &amp; can perform multiple tasks. A robot is a machineâespecially one programmable by a computerâcapable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Itï¿½s a robot whose arms have concurrent prismatic or rotary joints.</p>
<p>The voyager and pioneer spacecraft now traveling outside earthï¿½s solar system are also robots. A robot is a programmable mechanical device that can perform tasks and interact with its environment, without the aid of human interaction.
