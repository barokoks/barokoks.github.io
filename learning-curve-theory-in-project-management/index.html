<meta name="description" content="Learning Curve Theory In Project Management, A learning curve is a graphical representation of repetitive tasks that, when done on a continuous basis, lead to a reduction in activity duration, resources and costs. For the most complete picture of how your company is performing, you want to apply the learning curve model to as many areas as possible and see how they compare and influence each other.

Figure 1 shows a theoretical 85% learning curve. The learning curve theory can be applied to construction projects that are generally not repetitive in all respects, but that do contain elements of repetition if previous projects are taken into account. In project management, this theory is used for schedule and cost estimation. Learning curve theory can be applied to predicting cost and time to complete repetitive activities.
