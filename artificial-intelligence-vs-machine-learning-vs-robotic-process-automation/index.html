<p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) vs Machine Learning (ML) Ai applications when paired with conversational platforms, bots and other smart machines can. Ai can automate the functions, whereas rpa decreases human efforts, performs tedious tasks, and completes the work in a short time. Robotic process automation (rpa) is intended to automate repetitive. The main idea of robotics is to develop machines that can substitute humans and replicate humans’ tasks..</p>

As technological advancements make machine learning processes easier to create, it’s possible that machine learning could act as a failsafe in automated procedures.
