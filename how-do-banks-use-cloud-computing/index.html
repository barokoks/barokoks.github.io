Business and Cloud Computing The Cloud Infographic From thecloudinfographic.com
Banks are using cloud outsourcing for an increasing number of use cases, from fraud detection to communications. Banks can do more banking and invest more time and money in optimizing the customer experience when they don�t have to continue putting up capital for hardware and software at data centers. For financial services organisations, this means we can outsource the management of our datacentre and related. For use cases such as data analytics, batch processing and data storage, banks can access the cloud as and when required, which means they can utilise such resources more flexibly and efficiently.
