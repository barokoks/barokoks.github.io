What is artificial intelligence (AI)? FierceElectronics From fierceelectronics.com
Ai lets a machine perceive the world around it by acquiring and processing images, sounds, speech, text, and other data. Leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: Agi is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.

<p>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for L&amp;D Degreed Blog Agi is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Before reaching superintelligence, general ai means that a machine will have the same cognitive capabilities as a human being. What does artificial intelligence (ai).</p>
