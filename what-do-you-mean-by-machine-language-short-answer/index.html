“spam” is a positive class (y = 1) and “not spam” is the negative class (y = 0). The chart of predicted class vs. 4gls are far removed from machine languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human languages. For an undecidable language, there is no turing machine which accepts the language and makes a decision for every input string w (tm can make decision for some input string though).
