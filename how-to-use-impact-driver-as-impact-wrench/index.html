Usually smaller and more lightweight than a power drill, an impact driver packs more punch with more torque than a power drill (again, torque is the twisting force). An impact wrench has an electric or air motor that applies a sudden, intense twisting motion to the recalcitrant lug nut, usually in short bursts (every five seconds or so). In general, impact wrenches are heavier, bulkier, and much more powerful (have more torque) than impact drivers. Usually smaller and more lightweight than a power drill, an impact driver packs more punch with more torque than a power drill (again, torque is the twisting force).
