Artificial Intelligence Definition, Types, Examples, Technologies by From medium.com
To help you decide how exactly ai can be put into practical use, we offer our classification based on our 32 years of experience in data science. Smart assistants like siri and alexa who can find recipes for dinner, order the ingredients and play just the right music while you cook. It is typically used to solve complex problems that are impossible to tackle with traditional code. Artificial narrow intelligence (ani), also referred to as weak ai or narrow ai, is the only type of artificial intelligence we have successfully realized to date.
