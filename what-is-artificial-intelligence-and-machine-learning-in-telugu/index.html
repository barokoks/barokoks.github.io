Machine learning vs. artificial intelligencewhat�s the difference? From enterpriseiotinsights.com
I came to a conclusion about t. In this introduction, you will view the course syllabus to learn what will be taught in this course. You will hear from data science professionals to discover what data science is, what data scientists do, and what tools and algorithms data scientists use on a daily basis. But if machines can think, it’d be artificial.
