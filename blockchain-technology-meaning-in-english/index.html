While that may be true in one way, there are so many other potential uses. A blockchain can be change if an entity controls 51% of the blockchain. When satoshi nakamoto created the world’s first ever cryptocurrency (bitcoin), he also created an amazing protocol known as the blockchain. What makes a blockchain immutable, meaning that it cannot be altered, is the fact that each transaction record is directly linked to the previous one using advanced cryptography.
