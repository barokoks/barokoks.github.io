<p>25 DIY Garden Bench Ideas Free Plans for Outdoor Benches Brain Benchmark Post your human benchmark scores here! Matches the preceding character at least n times and at most m times. Click here to play the sheep dash game! Its not physically possible to be faster than 150ms and thats to a touch stimulus. Someone is clearly running bots on the site as some of those numbers are insane.</p>

<p>DIY Garden Bench Ideas Free Plans for Outdoor Benches Human Audio stimulus are about 170ms and the fastest visual reaction time possible has been known to be hard capped by the speed of neurons firing at 190ms at the absolute fastest. One of the sprinters (female) had an average reaction time in the legs of 79 ms, and her fastest was 42 ms! Human benchmark measure your abilities with brain.</p>

The concept is pretty simple: So, in this piece, i am going to tell you about one of the “human benchmarking” tests that will tell you how fast you react. It�s an experience that can be artificially induced! In 2009, in an iaaf commissioned study, reaction times of seven finnish national level sprinters were measured. No systems are perfect, and you might have 50ms + added to your score if you have a monitor with high latency.</p>
