Usecases of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare From mindfieldsglobal.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) in healthcare is the use of complex algorithms and software to emulate human cognition in the analysis of complicated medical data. The artificial intelligence (ai) technologies becoming ever present in modern business and everyday life is also steadily being applied to healthcare. For example, ai that can scan millions of rows of data helps a doctor make a faster decision so they can spend time caring for the patient, not being an analyst. The company�s ai products can detect issues and notify care teams quickly, enabling providers to discuss options, provide faster treatment decisions and ultimately save lives.
