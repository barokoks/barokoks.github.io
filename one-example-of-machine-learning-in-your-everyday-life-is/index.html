Machine learning usecases Amit Bahree�s (useless?) insight! From desigeek.com
With the launch of the iphone x, apple launched a radical way of unlocking your iphone using just your face as a password. In the following section, we will list some of the best examples of artificial intelligence in everyday life. Using spoken commands to ask your phone to carry out a search, or make a call, relies on technology supported by machine learning. Ai technology is learning to recognize us, provide security, and assist our everyday lives.
