Computer vision syndrome is a complex ocular problems that translates to discomfort feeling on eyes due to high visual demands of computer viewing. Symptoms reported by computer users are classified into internal ocular symptoms (strain and ache), external ocular symptoms (dryness, irritation, burning), visual symptoms (blur, double vision) and musculoskeletal symptoms (neck and shoulder pain). Are an inherent component of modern lifestyle. Computer vision syndrome (cvs) is a combination of eye and vision problems associated with the use of digital devices.
