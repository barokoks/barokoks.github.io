<meta name="description" content="Example Of Artificial General Intelligence (Agi), One of the craziest inventions done by humans. Artificial general intelligence refers to a type of distinguished artificial intelligence that is broad in the way that human cognitive systems are broad, that can do different kinds of tasks well, and that really simulates the breadth of the human intellect, rather than focusing on more specific or narrower types of tasks.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by Prabhitha Nagarajan Medium From medium.com
Here are a few examples of agi in use. Artificial general intelligence (agi) also commonly known as strong ai or deep ai is basically the hypothetical intelligence of machines. Artificial general intelligence can be used to develop hostile attitudes or thoughts against humans, the minority could develop an agi with the goal to fulfill their own interests (conflict with general human interests), artificial general intelligence could take ethical rules too seriously (or extend them in its own way) and therefore do dangerous actions as for example. A chatbot uses natural language processing (nlp) to analyze what humans are saying and create a response.
