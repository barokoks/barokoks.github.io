Intelligence Quotient From slideshare.net
Even though genetic factors play the major role in determining iq, various other modifiable environmental influences can influence the iq of an individual. The intelligence quotient (iq) is a measure of intelligence that is adjusted for age. A score of 100 thus indicates a performance at exactly the normal level for that age group. When it was first created, it was defined as the ratio of mental age (ma) to chronological age (ca) multiplied by 100 (thus iq = ma/ca x 100).
