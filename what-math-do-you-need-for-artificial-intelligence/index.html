Math is a core educational pillar for data scientists, regardless of your future industry career path. You will need to learn some matlab /octave to complete that course. An intelligent agent that can plan makes a representation of the state of the world, makes predictions about how their actions will change it and make choices that maximize the utility (or value) of the available choices.
