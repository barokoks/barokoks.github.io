We can think of this concept as “general ai,” which has machines that can think and reason and even see and hear like humans (copeland, 2016). We are now doing more than ever with artificial intelligence (ai), especially in the health care sector. In addition to physician support, the benefits of ai in healthcare extend to information sharing and precision medicine. Currently, there are no standards for ai systems in healthcare, which raises concerns among doctors and patients.

Artificial Intelligence Transforming Health Care.</h3><p>The system can handle most tasks previously handled by humans while doing it faster and cheaper. It removes the manual health system into automatic, in which humans conduct the routine works/tasks in medical practice to the management of patients and medical resources. Currently, there are no standards for ai systems in healthcare, which raises concerns among doctors and patients. 18 ai technologies have the potential to process data, discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of healthcare. Through advances in artificial intelligence (ai), it appears possible for the days of misdiagnosis and treating disease symptoms rather than their root cause to move behind us. First, ai can use sophisticated algorithms that are being used to learn various features from a large volume of healthcare data same as it being used in.</p>
