This remains within the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. However, artificial intelligence is most commonly used in video games, where the computer is made to act as another player. The staff at scitech europa explains, âthe computer scientist john mccarthy coined the term artificial intelligence in 1956, and defines the field of artificial intelligence as âthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines.â as well as the term for the scientific discipline, artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence of a machine, program, or system, in. While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm),  it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.</p>
