(PDF) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in From researchgate.net
Applications of artificial intelligence to contemporary and emerging educational challenges, special issue of ai. Adaptive learning has already had a login / register huge impact on education across the globe, and as ai the student can maintain their own personal advances in the coming decades adaptive programs like information. Application of artificial intelligent techniques in power system stabilizers (psss) design since the 1960s, psss have been used to add damping to electromechanical oscillations. Current applications of ai in classrooms today, both startups and established companies seek to integrate ai into marketable products.
