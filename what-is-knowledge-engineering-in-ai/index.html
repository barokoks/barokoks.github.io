<p>How AI will transform knowledge worker capabilities Marketing Week Knowledge is the basic element for a human brain to know and understand the things logically. Process of knowledge engineering 1. Feature engineering can be seen as a generalization of mathematical optimization that allows for better analysis. Knowledge engineering is the technology behind the creation of expert systems to assist with issues. An artificial intelligence system has the following components.</p>
