Climatic factors such as absolute humidity have been associated with risk of lower respiratory tract infection. How can you control the spread of airborne diseases? Many pathogens transmit by direct contact between dogs or between dogs. Airborne diseases diseases caused by pathogens that small enough to be discharged from an infected person in a form of tiny drops called aerosols the pathogen remains suspended in air dust particles, or respiratory and water droplets that are &lt;5um in diameter.
