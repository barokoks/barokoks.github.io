What is Artificial Intelligence? Advantages and Disadvantages of AI From informationtech99990.blogspot.com
It is also used in big data and network processes like olap. Ai is the part of niche technology that is developed to automate computer programs to perform tasks on its own, like humans. So, if we apply this definition of “intelligence” to ai. It uses complex algorithms to make logic.
