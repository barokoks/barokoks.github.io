Machine Learning Definition, Methods and Types Of Machine Learning From marketing91.com
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning brings out the power of data in new ways, such as facebook suggesting articles in your feed. Data mining techniques employ complex algorithms themselves and can help to provide better organized data sets for the machine learning application to use. Machine learning ( ml) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
