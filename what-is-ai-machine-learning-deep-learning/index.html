Artificial intelligence is the concept of creating smart intelligent machines. Ai is the broadest science and engineering that mimics the human intelligence which encompasses the sub fields such as machine learning and deep learning.actually deep learning is a subset of. Machine learning and deep learning are both types of ai. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (ai) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention.
