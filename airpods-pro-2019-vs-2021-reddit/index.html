AirPods Pro versus Jabra Elite 75t — Which is the best wireless earbud From appleinsider.com
Since the airpods pro were released in october 2019, we haven�t seen an updated version, but that could change in 2021. Come in a case that now officially supports magsafe. I�d like to get some sort of cover but many of the listings say that they�re for the 2019 models, and i can�t seem to find any for the 2021 version. I’ve been using airpods pro for basically every video call platform with my 2020 intel mbp, and it’s been great.
