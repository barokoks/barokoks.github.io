How Much Does an Industrial Robot Cost? YouTube From youtube.com
The development, testing, and deployment of a similar artificial intelligence platform (mvp) would cost you anything between $20 thousand and $35 thousand. In one or two days of analysis and research, you should be able to come up with a few use cases. If you are worried about how to make an artificial intelligence program and how much does artificial intelligence cost, be cool! Baxter costs little more to purchase than the cost of paying the average human factory employee.
