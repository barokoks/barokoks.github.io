Qingkai�s Blog Machine learning 16 Using scikitlearn Part 4 From qingkaikong.blogspot.com
“in just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of ai are done,” said mit sloan professor. The teacher already knows the correct answers but. Supervised algorithms need humans to provide both input and the desired output, in addition. Machine learning is a computer programming technique that uses statistical probabilities to give computers the ability to “learn” without being explicitly programmed.
