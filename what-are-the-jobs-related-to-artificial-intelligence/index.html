The Link Between Artificial Intelligence Jobs and WellBeing From hai.stanford.edu
Ai engineers are responsible to build ai models using machine learning algorithms and deep learning neural networks to draw business insights. Automation and technology have shifted work in pursuit of lowering costs, increasing efficiency and production. Artificial intelligence is shaking up the world of work, automating out routine tasks and freeing workers to concentrate on the more creative elements of their job. The role of a big data engineer is to create an ecosystem for the business systems to interact efficiently.
