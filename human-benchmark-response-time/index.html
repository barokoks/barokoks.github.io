<p>How Successful People Handle Stress The box recorded deviation of response times as well as the number of errors in complex reaction time tests. Wireless mice have become quite popular these days, but with them come a few annoyances—namely, input lag. This test used a falling meter stick as a stimulus. Levels get progressively more difficult, to challenge your skills. Memorize them, and pick them.</p>

Human reaction time (hrt) is the amount of time elapsed between the application of a stimulus and a person�s response to it.
