<p>The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds). Iaas, paas, and saas were formally defined in 2011. These two standards are important because of their widespread use and the need for a cloud security professional to be conversant on each. <em>NIST Definition of Cloud Computing</em>, The nist definition characterizes important aspects of cloud computing and is intended to serve as a means for broad comparisons of cloud services anddeployment strategies, and to provide a baseline for discussion from what is cloud computing to how to best use cloud computing.</p>
