Progress has been made toward understanding different environmental risk factors, and the clearest evidence involves events. Environmental factors account for an estimated 40% of autism risk. The recurrence risk of pervasive developmental disorder in siblings of children with autism is 2% to 8%; Over the past 15 years or so, scientists.
