Active air sampling requires the use of a microbiology air sampler to physically draw a known volume of air over, or through, a particle collection device and there are two main types. Beginning in the 19th century, in the wake of the industrial revolution, increasing use of fossil fuels intensified the severity and frequency of air pollution episodes. Examples are mechanical collectors, wet scrubbers, fabric filters (baghouses),. Which of the following substances is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless radioactive gas.
