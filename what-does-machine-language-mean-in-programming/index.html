In machine language, the input is directly given as binary input which is processed by the machine. The data can also be specified and represented using only 0s and 1s. Machine languages comprise of binary digits 0s and 1s. Each digit represents either an instruction or data within the program.

<p>Why are high level languages known as machine independent &gt; Such a program is called machine language program. Machine languages comprise of binary digits 0s and 1s. Instructions written in that language and statements written in another language called machine code. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. Assembly language is comprehensible to.</p>

<p>Computer languages 11 Programs are created through programming languages to control the behavior and output of a machine through accurate algorithms, similar to the human communication process. Assembly languages have a syntax that is similar to the english language; It is easy to memorize the assembly language because some alphabets and mnemonics are used. It is read by the computer�s central processing unit.</p>

<p>Python Programming Language Introduction Computer directly understands a program written in the machine language. Machine language is the language understood by a computer. Although the toy machine language contains only 16 different instruction types, it is possible to perform a variety of interesting computations. In fact, any computation that can be done in the java programming language on your pc can also be done.</p>

In earlier when we have to create a picture or show data on the screen of the computer then it is very difficult to draw using only binary digits(0s and 1s). Programming made it easy to connect humans with computers. A computer language includes various languages that are used to communicate with a computer.</p>

So as a result, machine language program does not require any translator to convert from one form to another. A machine language is the native language of a computer system, no other language or programming language can be understood by a computer machine. Machine language can only be represented by 0s and 1s. Although the toy machine language contains only 16 different instruction types, it is possible to perform a variety of interesting computations.

<p>These commands can be interpreted into a code understood by a machine. Each instruction causes the cpu to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit operation on one or more units of data in the cpu�s registers or. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. <em>Source Code And Language Differences</em>, A computer language includes various languages that are used to communicate with a computer machine.</p>
