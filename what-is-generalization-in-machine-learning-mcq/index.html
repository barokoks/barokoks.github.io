General Science MCQ ON Excretory (ରେଚନ) System. YouTube From youtube.com
Machine learning is a branch of computer science which deals with system programming in order to automatically learn and improve with experience. The learning process starts with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, so that we can seek for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples. In machine learning, generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data. A neural network that contains feedback.
