PPT Artificial Intelligence PowerPoint Presentation ID25990 From slideserve.com
Remarkable surges in ai capabilities have led to a wide range of innovations including autonomous vehicles and connected internet of things devices in our homes. Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. The artificial intelligence is the next step in this process to make it more effective by applying logical, analytical, and more productive technologies into this effort. So, in other words, if it doesn’t have enough information it can’t act rationally.
