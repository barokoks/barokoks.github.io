Airborne Coronavirus Water Quality and Health Council From waterandhealth.org
Many clinically important airborne diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.[1] these organisms may be transmitted through sneezing, coughing, spraying of liquids, the spread of dust, talking, or any activity that results in. Airborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microbes small enough to be discharged from an infected person via coughing, sneezing, laughing and close personal contact or aerosolization of the microbe. An airborne disorder is any disease that is caused by a microorganism that is transmitted through the air. These droplets are expelled when someone with the airborne disease sneezes, coughs.

<p>COVID19 is confirmed to have airborne transmission ability, but the But some studies show viral particles can get stuck in tiny aerosols less than 5 micrometers in diameter. The cdc recently updated its coronavirus information to note the coronavirus’s “potential for airborne spread.”. The traditional definition of airborne transmission is that small droplets containing a pathogen remaining viable over long time periods travel long distances in the air and infect.</p>
