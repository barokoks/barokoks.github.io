Machine learning and artificial intelligence are often used as interchangeable terms, but they are not the same thing. It uses machine learning, after all. If you’ve heard of machine learning, but aren’t entirely sure what it is, don’t worry. The word artificial intelligence comprises of two words “artificial” and “intelligence”.
