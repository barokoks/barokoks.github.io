Cambridge university graduate application process From tournesolbio.com
Please note that separate registration is required in many cases. You are normally expected to hold, or to be about to achieve, a first class or high ii.i honours degree (or the equivalent from an overseas institution, please see the international qualifications page) in chemical engineering, engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, applied mathematics, physics, biological science or related subjects. Engineering education at trinity is designed to complement the full programme of lectures and laboratory work conducted within the cambridge university engineering department (cued). Our ‘guesstimate’ is that the average successful applicant has around eight 8/9 grade gcses under their belt.
