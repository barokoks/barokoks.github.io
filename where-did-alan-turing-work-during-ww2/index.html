<p>Is Alan Turing Both Inventor of the Basic Ideas of the Modern Computer Alan turing arrived at bletchley park when most thought german codes were impossible to crack and yet he was able to crack the uncrackable code. The enigma rotors were intricate and sophisticated. This code, engineered by the germans, was not easy to break in. There turing and his colleagues worked to break german military codes.
