Finally, artificial intelligence (ai) is the broadest term used to classify machines that mimic human intelligence. There are three main categories of ai: Though confusingly similar (they both break down to the ai abbreviation, after all) and with functions that can overlap, automated intelligence and artificial intelligence rarely mean — or do — exactly the same. While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm), it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.

<p>AI Versus Human Thought Which Will Prevail? Machine learning helps keep your inbox (relatively) free of spam. Here’s a head to head comparison between artificial intelligence and human intelligence: Machine learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world. Finally, artificial intelligence (ai) is the broadest term.</p>
