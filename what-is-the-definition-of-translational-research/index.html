<p>The Rockefeller University » Translational Research Translational research was designed for the medical world. The process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public. Basic research  is the systematic study directed toward greater knowledge  or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena  and is performed without thought of practical ends. Although the journal�s focus.</p>
