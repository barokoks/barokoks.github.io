<p>What You Need to Know About Artificial Intelligence Ai, a rational and harmonic interaction is required between. However, it is considered to be a branch of computer science. It’s not a confrontation, but rather a beneficial collaboration between automated robotics and humans. Unlike robotics, artificial intelligence is not a branch of technology. Up until quite recently, all industrial robots could only be programmed to carry out a repetitive.</p>
