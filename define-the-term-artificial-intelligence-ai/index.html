What is Artificial Intelligence [AI]? Definition, Features and Uses From computertechreviews.com
As well as the term for the scientific discipline, artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence of a. This is a complicated problem. “artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality. This remains within the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem.
