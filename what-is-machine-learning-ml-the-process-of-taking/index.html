At the very basic level, machine learning uses algorithms to find patterns and then applies the patterns moving forward. Even though there are numerous machine learning algorithms each with a different approach, there is a general procedure which is followed to solve any machine learning problem. This is the most crucial step in the machine learning workflow and takes up the most time as well. Hence, it continues to evolve with time.
