There are over 50 species of bacteria that cause plant diseases. Clubroot is a major problem in acidic soils (5.7 ph or lower). The thick, liquid exudate is primarily composed of bacteria and is a sign of the disease, although the canker itself is composed of plant tissue and is a symptom. The pathogens may enter the air in wet droplets, for example, when someone breathes or sneezes.
