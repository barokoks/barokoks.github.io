One of the greatest innovators in the field was john mccarthy, widely recognized as the father of artificial intelligence due to his astounding contribution in the field of computer science and ai. To avoid highlighting one of the tracks being pursued at. Mccarthy is credited for coining the phrase “artificial intelligence” and solidifying the orientation of the field.
