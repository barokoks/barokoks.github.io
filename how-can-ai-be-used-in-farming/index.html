Role of Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture From thinkml.ai
Farmers are increasingly using sensors and soil sampling to gather data and this data is stored on farm management systems that allows for better processing and analysis. To aid the crop growing process, data can be collected from sensors, drones, and satellites. Farmers use ai for methods such as precision agriculture; Common use cases of ai in agriculture include:
