<p>(3) What is the difference between data science, artificial Ai is a computer algorithm which exhibits intelligence through decision. Ml is a subset of ai that enables machines to learn and improve on their own without explicit human programming. Still, in the latter, the algorithm is a program that is designed to perform a specific task. that means that in the first two, the algorithm can learn something,. Data.</p>
