Artificial Intelligence is on biz execs� minds The adoption rate From workingnation.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is the attempt to let computers perform services for which humans need intelligence. Most artificial intelligence isn’t truly intelligent. Ai is starting to show signs of true intelligence when you have machines that can teach themselves. People have long dreamed of machines having the intelligence and capabilities of humans.
