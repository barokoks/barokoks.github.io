Machine Learning Engineer Job Description and Salary Robert Half From roberthalf.com
They work with data scientists to take information and feed curated data into the models that they�ve uncovered or discovered. Strong analytical skills are needed since the work that machine learning engineers do involves projecting outcomes and isolating issues that need to be resolved to make programs more effective. Machine learning engineers sit at the intersection of software engineering and data science. An ml engineer builds artificial intelligence (ai) systems that leverage huge data sets to generate and develop algorithms capable of learning and eventually making predictions.
