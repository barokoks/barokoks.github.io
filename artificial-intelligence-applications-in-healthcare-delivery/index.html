Top 10 Real World Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Education From theindianwire.com
The rediscovery of the potential of artificial intelligence (ai) to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes has led to an increasing application of ai techniques such as deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics in the healthcare domain. Sanders, mats terwiesch, william j. There are numerous healthcare apps on the mobile app store. Ai can enable healthcare systems to achieve their ‘quadruple aim’ by democratising and standardising a future of connected and ai augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (table (table1 1).30 research in the application of ai healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated.
