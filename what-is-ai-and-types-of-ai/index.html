Branches of AI Edureka There are 4 distinct categories of ai namely: Also known as artificial general intelligence (agi) and strong ai, general artificial intelligence is a type of ai that can think and function just as humans do. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,. In the simplest terms, ai which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines.</p>
