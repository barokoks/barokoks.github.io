Machine Learning Videos Reddit MOCHINV From mochinv.blogspot.com
Luckily, in the daily jobs, i’m like a full stack data scientist who needs to develop data pipelines, ml system and architecture, build models and serve models. In general, data scientists can expect to work on the modeling side more, while machine learning engineers tend to focus on the deployment of that same model. Ziprecruiter reports the average annual salary for a data scientist is $119,413 in the u.s. The job profile involves research in process mining.
