Soft computing is an approach where we compute solutions to the existing complex problems, where output results are imprecise or fuzzy in nature, one of the most important features of soft computing is it should be adaptive so that any change in environment does not affect the present process. The word ‘fuzzy’ means things that are not pretty much clear or doubtful. Neural network (nn) fuzzy logic (fl) genetic algorithm (ga) these methodologies form the core of soft computing. Soft computing may be viewed as a foundation component for the emerging field of conceptual intelligence. Soft computing is a paradigm which involves a model that can resolve issues which are not having proper prediction, involves unsure and imprecise solution.</p>
