<p>How Different Types of Artificial Intelligence can Add Value to Business? Artificial intelligence can be divided based on capabilities and functionalities. The study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in. Artificial narrow intelligence (narrow ai), artificial general intelligence (general ai) and artificial super intelligence (super ai). Finally, this research generates intelligent software systems. We are currently well past the first type and actively perfecting the second.</p>

What is Artificial Intelligence? How Does AI Work, Applications and Future?.</h3><p>Artificial narrow intelligence (ani), artificial general intelligence (agi), artificial super intelligence (asi) artificial narrow intelligence (ani) as almost everything in the field of ai falls under narrow ai, ani is the most commonly encountered type of ai. We will present the following examples: Theory of mind in artificial intelligence. Following is flow diagram which explain the types of ai. Artificial intelligence can be divided in various types, there are mainly two types of main categorization which are based on capabilities and based on functionally of ai. Based on functionalities, there are four types of artificial intelligence:</p>
