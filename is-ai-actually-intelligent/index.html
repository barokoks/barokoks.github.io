As ai becomes more important technologically. Yet, all the same, these machine learning systems are often touted as the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. But its advancements in machine learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. In crawford’s view, ai is neither artificial nor intelligent.

Some of them—especially those who understand what actual, biological intelligences are capable of—conclude that there’s nothing “intelligent” about ai at all. In truth, they’re actually quite dumb.
