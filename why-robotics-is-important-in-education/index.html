Why Science Education is Important in Early Childhood From firstdiscoverers.co.uk
Research has shown that, if students are taught robotics from their toddler age then it will increase their interest in machines as well as new technologies. If your child loves to tinker and would enjoy learning about stem in a concrete way, their new robotics project could be just the thing to help them envision a future in one of these.
