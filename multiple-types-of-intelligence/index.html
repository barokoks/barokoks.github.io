8 Intelligence Types Scientips From scientips.com
Being logically smart is an advantage when you’re in school. Multiple intelligences (mi) theory, on the other hand, claims on the basis of evidence from multiple sources that human beings have a number of relatively discrete intellectual capacities. The ic recognizes six major buckets of intelligence. This theory challenged the traditional notion that there is one single type of intelligence, sometimes known as “g” for general intelligence, that only focuses on cognitive abilities.

<p>Pin by Strategy 2 Design on Infographic Learning theory, Learning The different types of intelligence in gardner’s multiple intelligence theory are: He describes eight intelligences and outlined their characteristics. To broaden this notion of intelligence, gardner introduced eight different types of intelligences consisting of: Being logically smart is an advantage when you’re in school.
