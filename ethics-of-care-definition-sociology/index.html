<meta name="description" content="Ethics Of Care Definition Sociology, Learn the thoughts of carol gilligan and. 1 some theorists do not like the term “care” to designate this approach to moral issues and have tried substituting “the ethic of love,” or “relational ethics,” but the discourse keeps returning to “care” as, so far, the more satisfactory of the terms considered, though dissatisfactions with it remain.
Work and the ethics of care The Sociological Review From thesociologicalreview.org
The ethics of care perspective stands in stark contrast to ethical theories that rely on principles to highlight moral actions—such as kantian deontology, utilitarianism, and justice theory—and is not meant to be absolute and incontrovertible. Gilligan illustrated this difference in the moral reasoning of males and females by articulating the thinking of a boy and a girl participant�s responses to the “heinz dilemma” from kohlberg’s studies. The term ethics of care refers to ideas concerning both the nature of morality and normative ethical theory. Thus, an ethics of care is recognized for its practical value.
