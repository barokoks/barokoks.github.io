If you are a uk student enrolling on a standard length foundation degree or a ba/bsc at university college birmingham, your fee for this academic year will be £9,250. Across our education and research frameworks, we are embedding a culture of responsible business and inclusive values, and stepping up to be key contributors to the responsible business agenda. The university was founded as part of birmingham�s municipal technical school (predecessor of aston university) in the 19th century, but became a separate college of bakery, catering, domestic science and associated studies (later birmingham college of food and domestic arts) under the control of birmingham city council in 1957. Developed in close partnership with industry experts, our course will enhance your understanding of core business functions and activities, and how they work together in today’s global digital environment.
