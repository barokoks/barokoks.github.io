What is Artificial Intelligence? How Does AI Work, Applications and Future? From mygreatlearning.com
Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are in this category. The more humanlike the desired outcome, the more data and processing power required. What does artificial intelligence (ai) mean? An agent(e.g., human or robot) is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors.
