What is Research Gap? And How to Identify it Marketing91 From marketing91.com
Scholars bring the notion of research as a definite solution which enriches the existing understanding of a phenomenon. This is best done by surveying the current research and then identifying a gap that you are going to fill. As you have rightly noted, research is conducted to bridge or address a gap in knowledge. However, to understand or identify a gap in knowledge, you need to do a literature search, which is done before conducting the research.
