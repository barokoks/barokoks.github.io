A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (ai) that focuses on the design of systems that can learn from and make decisions and predictions based on data. The nomenclature is due to the fact that the learning process being supervised by the result which is already known. Bias (math) an intercept or offset from an origin. Supervised machine learning is an algorithm that learns from labeled training data to help you predict outcomes for unforeseen data.

<p>Machine learning explained Understanding supervised, unsupervised, and Supervised machine learning is defined as the subfield of machine learning techniques in which we used labelled datasets for training the model, making predictions of the output values and comparing its output with the intended, correct output, and then compute the errors to modify the model accordingly. Let’s see the different types of machine learning now: The nomenclature is due.</p>
