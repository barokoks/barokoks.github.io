Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education Top Use Cases From pixelplex.io
Artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and ultimately accelerate the progress towards sdg 4. Hence these systems have helped enhance oversight in the process of admissions. The usage of artificial intelligence in education is beginning to gain traction as it can provide a wide range of benefits for both learners and educators. Ai can understand a fair amount about student education.
