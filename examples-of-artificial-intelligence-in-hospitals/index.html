Hospitals Utilize Artificial Intelligence to Treat Patients From usnews.com
It is a great example of artificial intelligence in healthcare adjunct tools that will complement the expertise of radiologists. The ai got nearly 90% of cases right, by tracing brain activity invisible to the human eye, such as tiny changes in blood flow to the brain. To put it differently, the drugs coming in the market in 2020 were in their early stages of development in 2007 or 2005. Let’s look at a few of those examples of ai in the nhs:
