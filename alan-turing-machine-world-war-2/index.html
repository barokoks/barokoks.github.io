Germany�s naval prowess was well known and rightfully feared. During world war ii, turing served the allied forces by breaking german military codes, particularly those used by the german navy. The universal turing machine in 1936, turing had invented a hypothetical computing device that came to be known as the ‘universal turing machine’. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine, which.
