To complete the requirements step of the design process, you should write a design brief. In the engineering design process, we will start with defining the problem in such a way that an engineer will understand and be able to proceed to the next step in the process. A description of your target user. Test and implement the solution the first step in the design process is the problem definition.

Development Process.</h3><p>There are as many as eight steps in the engineering design cycle: It is a process that includes steps that can be repeated, although not always in the same order. A design brief gathers all the key information for solving your problem in one place. This process results in a set of drawings, calculations, and reports with the help of which the system can be fabricated.
