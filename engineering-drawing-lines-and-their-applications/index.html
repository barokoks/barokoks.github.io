<p>10 Different Types of Lines Used In Engineering Drawing By kelly curran glenn sokolowski. Types of lines explained with following timestamp: An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object. The bottom line joins the 0 o to the 180 o. Hidden lined (thick) hidden lined (thick) type lines consist of thick short dashes, closely and evenly spaced.</p>

This line is similar to the dash thin lines with dots except that it has double dots within it. Cutting plane, to draw the trace at section planes, g; A thin line made up of alternating long and short dashes is used to show the center of round or cylindrical objects, as. 4.23 drawing of an ellipse md. Thin hidden lines are used as intermittent line types.</p>
<p>In general application, thick lines are 0.6 mm(.024â). Principles of drawing specific objective use instruments for drawing, scales, lines, &amp; there applications.
