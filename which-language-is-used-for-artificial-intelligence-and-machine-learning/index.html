Both artificial intelligence and machine learning are closely connected and are being used widely today. Aiml is used to develop rules for matching patterns and response identification. Companies are incorporating techniques such as natural language processing and computer vision — the ability for computers to use human language and interpret images ­— to automate tasks, accelerate decision making, and enable. Python is the most used language for machine learning (which lives under the umbrella of ai).
