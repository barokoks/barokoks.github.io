How Different Types of Artificial Intelligence can Add Value to Business? From quytech.com
Biometric categorization systems are defined as ai systems ‘for the purpose of assigning natural persons to specific categories, such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, ethnic origin or sexual or political orientation, on the basis of their biometric data’ (article 3(35)). It identifies people according to how they interact with online applications and devices. Being able to use artificial intelligence to identify and automatically respond to data breaches is incredibly important for protecting the data and privacy of a company and its customers. Machine learning algorithms automatically learn.
