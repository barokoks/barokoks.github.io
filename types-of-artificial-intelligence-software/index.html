On instagram, ai considers your likes and the accounts you follow to determine what posts you are shown on your explore tab. Artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming an essential of all business software since they offer users the functionalities such as automation or predictive abilities. This type of ai, along with the ability of reactive machines, have memory capabilities so they can use past information/experience to make better future decisions. Machines process and communicate in a different way than the human brain.
