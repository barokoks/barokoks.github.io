The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Industry 4.0 » Cleverativity From cleverativity.com
It is characterized by the fusion of technologies that merge the physical, digital, and biological spheres. And a few decades later the fourth industrial revolution, also known as industry 4.0, has arrived to reshape manufacturing through a deep harnessing of data to automate, predict, control, and optimize operations. The fourth industrial revolution emerged a few decades ago, known as industrial revolution 4.0 or smart manufacturing industry 4.0. Technologies adopted by industry 4.0 an online service that provides technical writing help to students mentions that industry 4.0 is still using resources used by its predecessors, such as electricity, electronics.
