Malaria is a disease caused by an organism belonging to protista. Bloodborne pathogens are passed along through blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids, whereas airborne pathogens can be transmitted through the air—either falling to surfaces in droplets emitted when an infected person breathes or coughs, or hanging in the air in aerosolized form. They hang in the air much like invisible smoke. Many clinically important airborne diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
