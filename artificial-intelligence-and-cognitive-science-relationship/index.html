<p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Computer Science Notes&hellip; Artificial intelligence (ai), known by some as the industrial revolution (ir) 4.0, is going to change not only the way we do things, how we relate to others, but also what we know about ourselves. However, cognitive science, [13], is important for ai. Ai systems that emulate human intelligence. Artificial intelligence and research on consciousness have reciprocally influenced each other:.</p>
