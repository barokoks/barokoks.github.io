Types of Machine Learning Algorithms You Should Know by David Fumo From towardsdatascience.com
Machine learning algorithms are defined as the algorithms that are used for training the models, in machine learning it is divide into three different types, i.e., supervised learning( in this dataset are labeled and regression and classification techniques are used), unsupervised learning (in this dataset are not labeled and techniques like dimensionality reduction and clustering are. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the machine needs. That is why it is important to know what types of machine learning algorithms are out there. Supervised learning algorithms are the ones that involve direct supervision (cue the title) of the operation.
