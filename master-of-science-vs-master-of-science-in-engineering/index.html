Students pursuing a master of science in engineering must decide on their degree’s track: These disciplines tend to award more of their own specialised degrees than the arts and humanities. A master of science in engineering can require completion of a thesis and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a doctor of philosophy (often abbreviated ph.d.
