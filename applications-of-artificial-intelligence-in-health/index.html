How Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare is Used Techhong From techhong.com
From hospital care to clinical research to drug development and insurance, artificial intelligence (ai) applications are recasting the health sector’s workings to cut down on expenses and improve patient outcomes. There have been a great number of technological advances within the field of ai and data science in the past decade. Applications of ai in healthcare from employing it to detect links between genetic codes, put to use surgical robots, or even for maximizing hospital efficiency, ai has proven to be a boon for the healthcare industry Ai in healthcare can prove useful within clinical decision support to help doctors make better decisions faster with pattern recognition of health complications that are registered far more accurately than by the human brain.
