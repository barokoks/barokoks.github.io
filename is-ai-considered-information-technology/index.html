Artificial intelligence (ai) is rapidly transforming our world. “ [ai] is going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. And the information technology systems are concerned with capturing, storing, analyzing, and evaluating data to communicate the best output as a piece of information. Information technology (it) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data.
