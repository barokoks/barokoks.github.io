Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Machine learning can be described as the ability to continuously statistically learn from data without explicit programming. Machine learning is a purely analytical discipline. The goal of ai is to make a smart computer system like humans to solve complex problems.
