Why a High IQ Isn�t Enough Emotional Quotient.</h3><p>Having a high eq means you know your strengths and you know how to lean into them and use them to your full advantage while keeping your weaknesses from holding you back. These abilities in an eq test suggest a closer parallel with iq. In bradberry’s studies, 90 percent of top performers are high in eq and just 20 percent of bottom performers are high in eq.
