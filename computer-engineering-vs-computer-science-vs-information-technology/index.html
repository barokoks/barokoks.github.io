Computer Science vs Computer Engineering Which Degree is Best for You From thecoderpedia.com
The field of computer engineering tends to prioritize computer design and development, whereas computer science places a heavier emphasis on computing theory, translating to a greater focus on cybersecurity, algorithms, and computer networks. Computer science is concerned with the efficient and correct execution of computational tasks. Three different disciplines generally fall under the category of computer science: Essentially, computer scientists create the building blocks that information technology professionals use to construct an operational technological system.
