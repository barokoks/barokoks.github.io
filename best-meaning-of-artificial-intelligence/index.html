The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Ai also needs to operate on the latest hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. The ability of ai to conceive and execute appropriate actions that have the best possibility of achieving a certain objective is its ideal attribute.
