New AI’s Creators Believe Creation Is Too Dangerous to Release to From lddailyadvisor.blr.com
An apathetic ai is dangerous simply because it does not take human safety into account, as all humans naturally do. With automation, malicious acts such as phishing, delivery of viruses to software, and taking advantage of ai systems because of the way they see the world, might be difficult for humans to uncover until. However, even though he has this thought, he is of the belief that the positive prospects of it outweigh the negative consequences. Ai’s threat is not that it will be a sadistic megalomaniac (unless we deliberately, or carelessly make it that way) but that it will follow its own evolutionary imperative.
