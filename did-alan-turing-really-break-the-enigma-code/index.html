What Was the Enigma Code and How Was It Cracked? From historymates.com
Alan turing, the second world war codebreaker who took his own life after undergoing chemical castration following a conviction for homosexual activity, has been granted a posthumous royal. Turing helped design a machine that could try possible engima machine settings very, very quickly, and based on an analysis of a flaw in the enigma machine itself as well as the repetitive way the nazis used the machine, he figured out which machine settings were most likely, and then they would try running those settings until they got an output that was actual words instead of.
