Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning From certbuddyz.com
Artificial intelligence can be considered as the study and design done by the intelligent agent using various kinds of tools by analyzing the required based environment and produce such actions which helps in maximizing success. Ai is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Food made in the laboratory lacks lifeforce that only nature and passionate humans can bring to it. While one doctor can make a diagnosis in ~10 minutes, ai system can make a million for the same time.
