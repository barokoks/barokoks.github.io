Machine Learning Handson Python Course in Hindi What is Machine From youtube.com
Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is where the cost function comes into the picture. अगर सिर्फ इस word का मतलब hindi में समझे तो artificial का मतलब “कृत्रिम” यानि की आदमी के द्वारा बनाया हुआ. Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning.
