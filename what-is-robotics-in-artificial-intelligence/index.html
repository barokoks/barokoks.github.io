<p>Are The Robots Coming For Us? Misconceptions About AI And Machine Robots are physical machines built with sensors/actuators to independently interact with their environment. However you choose to define a robot, robotics involves designing, building and programming physical robots which are able to interact with the physical world. Artificial intelligence and robotics are two adjacent, but entirely separate, fields in the future. What sets such a robot apart from others is.</p>
