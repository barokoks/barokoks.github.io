<p>Electrical Engineer Carnegie STEM Girls Mechanical engineers design and develop physical products. Typically, a design engineer works on designing software like cad (computer aided designs) to design a product structure. Engineering design is systematic and iterative. Steps include things like planning, modeling, testing, and improving designs. It is a process that includes steps that can be repeated, although not always in the same order.</p>
