Engineering, Mathematics, &amp; Physics Western Nevada College From wnc.edu
Physics is the study of energy and matter in our natural world. So what engineering physics does is to help us know, learn and get a detailed overview about all these hot &amp; exploding subfields of physics. This thus helps pave the way for a physicist in the making to choose a particular field of his/her own interest, so as to make a specialization in it after graduating from the bachelor’s degree. “engineers are generally concerned with designing and/or making things that work.
