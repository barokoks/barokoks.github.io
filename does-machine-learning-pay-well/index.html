Exploring the Mystery Behind Different Job Titles for Machine Learning From medium.com
The collective benefit from using machine learning does not rest alone on analyzing big data to extract information automatically. So in the uk, there is a clear £10,000 margin between the two ml roles. Thanks to machine learning, people can know what is in every single video without having to download it. Remember, it is a much broader role than machine learning engineer.
