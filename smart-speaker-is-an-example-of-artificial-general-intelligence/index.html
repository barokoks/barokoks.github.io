What is Artificial Intelligence? Udacity From blog.udacity.com
Cameras, gyroscopes, accelerometers, gps, and other sensors combine to create a virtual representation superimposed on the real world. This is the technology that powers many of today’s powerful applications such as chatbots and google’s highly accurate translation engine. The method is a major breakthrough in computer vision modeling. Today there is specialized ai everywhere, siri, facial recognition, snapchat filters, amazon.com recommendations, nest thermostats and hundreds more examples that we almost take for granted.

<p>7 Key Predictions for the Future Of Voice Assistants and AI Unite.AI There are two main types of ai, specialized and general. But that’s not the case. For example, children can command assistant to play space trivia with them. Because smart speakers can carry out multiple functions (such as tell a joke, play music, etc.) it is an example of artificial general intelligence (agi). Cameras, gyroscopes, accelerometers, gps, and other sensors combine.</p>
