AirPods Pro vs AirPods Max Which should you buy? From thenwire.com
While the bose headphones do a decent job between 100hz and 1000hz, it falls a bit short when it comes to sounds below 100hz. This one’s pretty easy to measure. I just bought the airpods max and i compared them to the qc35ii. The price is primarily a reflection of the increase in audio quality, as well as the addition of noise cancellation.
