Python is one of the most popular programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because of its readability. But among all those programming languages, python seems to top the list of favorites majorly due to the ease of use with which developers can handle complex coding challenges with python. Prolog is major ai programming language used for artificial intelligence capable of satisfying different needs in development and designing of different software.
