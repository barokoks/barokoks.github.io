An overview of the cloudintegrated smart grid architecture with access From researchgate.net
Advances in computational power and numerical optimization routines have enabled the possibility of applying rigorous simulation and optimization techniques to large scale problems such as those associated with the design, optimization and control of integrated chemical processes and energy systems. The finance model in the pu&amp;r industry is incredibly complex and because of that, finance leaders must constantly balance their responses to three groups of challenges shared below. It centralizes the data storage, processing, and bandwidth which in turn provides efficient computing to the user. It consists of virtual machines, servers, data storage, security mechanisms, etc.
