Academic researchers from england and sweden designed a malware that can exploit a smartphone’s microphone to steal the device’s passwords and codes. The global market for the internet of things (iot) reached $100 billion in revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around $1.6 trillion by 2025. Internet of things (iot) is a developing technology that provides the simplicity and benefits of exchanging data with other devices using the cloud or wireless networks. Multiple other vulnerable situations on iot’s have been reported in finance monthly in 2019 like the spying doll cayla, hackable medical devices and insecure home thermostat.
