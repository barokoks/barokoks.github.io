Ai has been around for a while and it is here to stay. Ml, for example, can make predictions using statistical algorithms and perform tasks beyond what it was explicitly programmed for. It is considered one of the best examples of ai in everyday life with improvements that increase the quality of the platform as well as the customer experience. Innumerable developers are leveraging the latest deep learning innovative technologies to take their business to the new high.
