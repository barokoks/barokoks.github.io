<p>Who�s To Blame When Artificial Intelligence Systems Go Wrong Artificial intelligence (ai) is now on everyone’s lips, and shortly, it will transform the way we live. Artificial intelligence now affects productivity, employment, and competitive behavior in significant ways. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. It.</p>

<p>5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Changing The Future Of Manufacturing Ai which stands for artificial intelligence is a technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis.</p>
