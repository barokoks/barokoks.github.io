What does a Machine Learning Engineer do? Career Insights From freelancermap.com
Knowledge of java, python, scala, data modelling, programming, probability, machine learning algorithms, statistics, and system design is very important to become a machine learning engineer. To do this, you’ll need to come up with and test out various experimental algorithms that yield results relevant to the task at hand. A data scientist lives somewhere between these two worlds. Algorithms can then learn from these data sets, becoming autonomous models capable of making predictions.
