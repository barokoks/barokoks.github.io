<meta name="description" content="How To Find Intelligence Quotient, An intelligence quotient, or iq, is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. Historically, iq is a score obtained by dividing a person�s mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person�s chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months.
Intelligence Quotient From slideshare.net
The equation (ma/ca) * 100 = iq may calculate the intelligence quotient (iq), where ma is mental age and ca is chronological age. This number is the score of a standard test to measure intelligence. Intelligence quotient (iq) this is a mathematical formula that is supposed to be a measure of a person�s intelligence. The intelligent quotient is obtained by dividing the mental age (ma) by the chronological age (ca) so that children of different chronological age can be compared.
