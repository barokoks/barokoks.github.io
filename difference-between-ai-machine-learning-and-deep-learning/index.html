It uses a huge amount of structured as well as unstructured data to teach computers and predicts accurate results. Artificial intelligence gives rise to machine learning and deep learning. Deep learning enables a machine to make the decision with the help of artificial neural networks. The primary difference is that machine learning is a type of ai. 3) deep learning is an advancement on ml, which again is still narrow ai.</p>
