Turing�s contribution had to do with producing a computer that helped break the code. His method was known at bletchley park simply.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday, Alan Turing Father Of Computing KB SEZ J.) jack good, who joined in may 1941. One of the greatest minds in the history of humankind was lost forever, and one of the greatest heroes of world war ii died in shame and disgrace. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the story of enigma was declassified and turing could be recognized for his significant contributions to modern computer.</p>

Turing returned to bletchley in march 1943, where he continued his work in cryptanalysis. Turing�s contribution had to do with producing a computer that helped break the code. And, what else did he do apart from cracking the enigma code? Our hero was legally abused and tortured.</p>
