Iâll answer as a student at uiuc whoâs actually made an idt to computer engineering (albeit not from eng physics but from mechanical) idtâs (at uiuc at least) can be easy or difficult based on what major youâre transferring to and from. It is one of the oldest.</p>

<p>A Torque on Conventional Wisdom Physics UIUC It is a rigorous curriculum in the science of mechanics with an emphasis on physics and applied mathematics. The engineering physics major requires ~105 units because of the extra engineering courses students take. Engineering mechanics at uiuc engineering mechanics (em) is a fully accredited engineering program. Conservation laws and hydrodynamic equations, sound waves, and transport. This is higher than $61,050,.</p>
