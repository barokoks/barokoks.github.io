The Turing test, and how to pass it WIRED UK From wired.co.uk
It was one of five supercomputers to beat the famous test, and was first. Turing based his test on the “imitation game”, a party game in which a man pretended to be a woman and a judge tried to guess who was who by asking the concealed players questions. Knowledge, reasoning, language understanding, learning problem: The basic concept behind the test is that if a human judge is engaged in a natural language conversation with a computer where he cannot reliably distinguish machine from human, the machine passes the test.

The turing test, originally called the imitation game by alan turing in 1950, is a test of a machine�s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

Considered to be a groundbreaking achievement in ai voice technology, google duplex is also far from passing the turing test. An artificial intellect (or artilect), according to dr. Current ai systems have demonstrated the capacity for attaining or exceeding defined test goals for intelligence. The basic concept behind the test is that if a human judge is engaged in a natural language conversation with a computer where he cannot reliably distinguish machine from human, the machine passes the test. If the examiner cannot distinguish a human response from a computer responding like a human, the computer passes the turing test.</p>
<p>The test is named after alan turing, an english mathematician who pioneered machine learning during the 1940s and 1950s.
