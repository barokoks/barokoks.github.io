Everybody is now searching for the simple definition of internet of things, we are presenting below most simple meaning of iot that can be understood by even dummies. The internet of things (iot) is a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. Iot is an old concept that has been taking shape for the past few decades.
