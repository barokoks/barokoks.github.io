Just like we have eyes to sense light, ears to sense sound, and nerves in our skin that sense if something is touching us, robots have light sensors and cameras so they can “see,” microphones so they can “hear,” and pressure sensors so they can “feel” the things around them. Chances are they.</p>

<p>Think cellphones are bad? Just watch what robots can do to kids 3 more than a million industrial robots are now in use, nearly half of them in japan. Humans tend to rig most games so that only they could win. Other robots must always have a person telling them what to do. You might create such a test using the original turing test as a guide. And none of them knew.</p>

A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within.
