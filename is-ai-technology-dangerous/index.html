For example, if ai is responsible for ensuring the operation of our power grid and our worst fears are realised, and the system goes rogue or gets hacked by an enemy, it could result in massive harm. The use of artificial intelligence (ai) has tremendously changed the way we see and understand how this advanced technology can make our lives more digestible. There are four different ways that artificial intelligence can be dangerous, some are intentional why some aren’t. But are ai advances unethical or a risk to the future of humanity? Algorithms are already creating real harm.</p>
