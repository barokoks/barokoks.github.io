AI Definition and Examples From vapulus.com
At its core, ai is the branch of computer science that aims to answer turing�s question in the affirmative. Many times, students get confused between machine learning and artificial intelligence, but machine learning, a fundamental concept of ai research since the field’s inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

<p>What is Artificial Intelligence [AI]? Definition, Features and Uses In simpler terms, it is making computers think like humans. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Achieving this end requires three key components: Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this.</p>
