Rather than studying all the millions of possible moves simultaneously, as deep blue and its successors do, the new ai (nicknamed giraffe) is able to �think� intuitively as it. No human has beaten a computer in a chess tournament in 15 years. At least on the human standards. Ai can beat.</p>

<p>AI Ruined Chess. Now, It’s Making the Game Beautiful Again WIRED Chess computer engines are currently much stronger than humans. More complex games form part of ai’s next frontier. Ai has bested us at board games like chess and go, and set astronomically high scores in classic computer games like ms. No human has beaten a computer in a chess tournament in 15 years. At least on the human standards.</p>
