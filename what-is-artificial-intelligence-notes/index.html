<p>Artificial Intelligence Notes Set6 Knowledge is the information acquired through experience. Artificial intelligence is slowly making its way into real time applications. Artificial intelligence is an interdisciplinary field that combines concepts of multiple fields like mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science which looks it difficult to learn at a glance. Robots are what come to. The term was coined in 1956 by john mccarthy.</p>
