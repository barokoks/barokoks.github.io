Artificial intelligence in manufacturing Business Going Digital From businessgoing.digital
Robotics and processes, edited by j.s. Thus, smart manufacturing is evolving. Artificial intelligence (ai) is driving the robotics market into various areas, including mobile robots on the factory floor, robots that can do a large number of tasks rather than being specialized on one, and robots that can stay in control of inventory levels as well as fetching orders for delivery. In the field of robotics and artificial intelligence (ai) our researchers develop intelligent robotic agents to solve problems in manufacturing, clinical healthcare, transportation, search and rescue, and most importantly agents that will improve the quality of life by assisting in daily activities such as wellness needs and education.
