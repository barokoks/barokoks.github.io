AirPods 2nd Generation 2019 All Hype or Worth Getting? Review From allforgreatness.com
They have decent battery life, come in their own charging case, and even have touch controls for playing and pausing music.

You can always walk into an apple store and try on both though before you come to a decision. Yes, the airpods 2 are still worth buying, even though the airpods 3 are pretty great commentary:
