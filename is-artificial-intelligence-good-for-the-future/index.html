Future of Artificial Intelligence and its Legal Status RACOLB LEGAL From racolblegal.com
But the future of artificial intelligence is about building strong ai. Today, it is known as weak ai (due to limitations). The lesson here is that ai is a tool, just like any other, and its efficacy is almost entirely down to the health and sanctity of its data.
