<p>Understanding Relationship Between IOT and Big Data Differences Iot finds more consensus, represents an opportunity for development. These connected objects generate data, which can be analyzed to reveal trends and information for various purposes. Cloud computing helps to collaborate in iot development. In a digitally connected world, data is generated at staggering speeds, and organizations must find. Besides, these gadgets will assemble, investigate, share, and transmit information continuously.</p>
