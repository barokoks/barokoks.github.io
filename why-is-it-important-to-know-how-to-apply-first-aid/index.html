How Much is Too Much? Mental Health First Aid From mentalhealthfirstaid.org
First aid is an important tool in quickly responding to accidents to ensure that injuries can be efficiently and promptly dealt with before a trained medical professional arrives to administer more specialised treatment. For example, using direct pressure to control bleeding can prevent the victim from going into shock due to severe blood loss (hypovolemic shock). And you may be able to help save a life. The importance of first aid is hard to overestimate.
