What is artificial intelligence (AI)? FierceElectronics From fierceelectronics.com
Though this sounds plain, there are still subtle issues to be. He said, ‘every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. Artificial intelligence is the branch of computer science that attempts to solve problems for which there is no known efficient solution, but which we know are efficiently solvable, (typically) because some intelligence can solve the problem (often in real time). John mccarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ in the 1950s.
