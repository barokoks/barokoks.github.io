Engineering Design Process Steps Pltw From dsignwesome.blogspot.com
Engineering is applied science, using scientific theories and research to solve problems technologically. Then, through pltw virtual core training, teachers are empowered to develop the skills and tools they need to inspire students. Complete a design project utilizing all steps of a design process, and find a solution that meets specific design requirements. Students dig deep as they apply the engineering design process, principles, and standards, developing their creativity and critical thinking skills along the way.
