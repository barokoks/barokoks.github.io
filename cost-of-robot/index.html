Since the robot is using classic programming methods, you will also need an offline station to be. However, enterprise organizations may need as much as $20 million, for a complete rpa solution of up to 500 robots, which can displace over 1,000 employees, and generate over $100 million in savings. The average cost of industrial robots worldwide declined steadily over the past decade, from about 46,000 u.s. Typically, an industrial robotic arm will cost anywhere between $25,000 and $400,000.
