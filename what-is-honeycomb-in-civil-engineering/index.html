The intensity of honeycombs can vary from one or two incidents to the whole surface being affected. Honeycombing is a very common defect found in concrete structures. Small size honeycombs (depth is less than 25mm) moderate size honeycombs (deeper than 25 mm but steel bars have not exposed) Applying excess and improper vibrations to concrete.
