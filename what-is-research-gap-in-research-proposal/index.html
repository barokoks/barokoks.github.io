Research gaps can be located in the introduction section of research articles, discussions and future research sections in research papers or journals, which researchers have already published. There is insufficient information in the literature review to consider as fact but supposition. This appears as a huge gap in what one must believe when the source for this information likely gave support for his claim that ethical considerations must occur. A research gap is a question or a problem that has not been answered by any of the existing studies or research within your field.
