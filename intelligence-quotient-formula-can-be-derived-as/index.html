Iq scores can range from 40 to 160. The first of these was developed by french psychologist alfred binet in 1905. Intelligence quotient (iq) is the score of an intelligence test that is a number derived from. He proposed that an individual’s intelligence level be measured as a quotient (hence the term “intelligence quotient”) of their estimated mental age divided by their chronological age.
