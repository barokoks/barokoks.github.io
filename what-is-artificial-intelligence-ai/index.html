What Artificial Intelligence(AI) will look like in 100 From medium.com
Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer program to learn and think. In computer science ai research is defined as the study of intelligent agents: Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that seeks to simulate human intelligence in a machine. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the basis for mimicking human intelligence processes through the creation and application of algorithms built into a dynamic computing environment.

Artificial Intelligence AI Training Root2Learn.</h3><p>Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks. So, ai is just a collective term for machines that can think. Agi, sometimes referred to as strong ai, is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from westworld or data from star trek: Robots are what come to. Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Artificial intelligence (ai) aims to develop machines that can accomplish what a human can in terms of reasoning.</p>
<p>In computer science ai research is defined as the study of intelligent agents: Leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: Ai’s true meaning comes from combining rational, emotional and cognitive levels of intelligence across a larger process. <em>Artificial Intelligence AI Training Root2Learn</em>, Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence  demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals  including humans.</p>
