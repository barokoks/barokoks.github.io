One of the ways that humans cause the most air pollution is by burning fossil fuels. When breathing polluted air, the risk of developing lung diseases increases. Emissions from different transport modes, the burning of fossil fuels, industrial production, forest fires, aerosol use and radiation fare some of the main causes of air pollution. Such sources of emissions liberate gases and substances that are toxic for human beings, the most harmful of which are:
