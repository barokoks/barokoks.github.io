What Is Machine Learning? PCH Technologies From pchtechnologies.com
Intelligent agents are supposed to maximize its performance measure. An intelligent agent is a type of software application that searches, retrieves and presents information from the internet. This agent works only on the basis of current perception and it does not bother about the history or previous state in which the system was. Artificial intelligence is defined as the study of rational agents.
