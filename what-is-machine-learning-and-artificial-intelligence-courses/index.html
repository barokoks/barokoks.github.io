Free * 7 weeks long. Artificial intelligence (ai) refers to the development of computer systems that mimic a human brain and enable them to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. Machine learning is a specific form of ai that allows computers to learn and grow after they are introduced to scenarios in the form of data. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (ai) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
