Iq= ma/ca x 100 [ma is mental age. Among the first to investigate individual differences in mental ability was a british scientist, sir francis galton, who compared people based on their awards and accomplishments. Historically, even before iq tests were devised, there were attempts to classify people into intelligencecategories by observing their behavior in daily life. Lamiell (1996) notes that if mentioned at all, stern is known as “the iq guy,” which in one sense is true enough.
