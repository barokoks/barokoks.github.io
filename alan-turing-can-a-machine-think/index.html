This question was already proposed in the middle of the last century by one of the fathers of computer science: Seventy years of commentary has been produced about turing’s 1950 proposal. The question whether machines can think is more complex than it appears at first sight.

<p>I propose to consider the question, �Can machines think?� Computing machinery and intelligence is a seminal paper written by alan turing on the topic of artificial intelligence. Although turing (1950) is pretty informal, and, in some ways rather idiosyncratic, there is much to be gained by considering the discussion that turing gives of potential objections to his claim that machines—and, in particular, digital computers—can “think”. How alan turing found.</p>

The paper, published in 1950 in mind, was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the turing test to the general public. A simple yet sophisticated question asked in “computing machinery and intelligence” by alan turing, who is best known for his integral role in cracking enigma,.</p>

In 1950, alan turing posed the question “can machines think?” in a paper. “how could we detect the display of intelligence in a machine?” he must have asked himself. However he found the form of the question unhelpful, that even the process of defining ‘machines’ and ‘think’ in common terms would be dangerous, as it could mistakenly lead one to think the answer can be obtained from some kind of statistical. There he went on to describe a task, now known as the turing.</p>
