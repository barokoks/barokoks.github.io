The general feeling is that it will create new jobs, but also make large numbers of others unnecessary. As i said about intelligence, it is all about getting exposure to new things, and use common sense to make decisions. Computers don’t need vacations or sleep, they can work without stopping. On the other hand, human creatures are made with the intrinsic capacity to think, reason, review, etc.

<p>Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence Machine learning, that is a branch of ai, allows computers to draw conclusions from the received data and send such findings to artificial intelligence applications. In the summer of 1956, the field of artificial intelligence was born at dartmouth college. Artificial intelligence [ai] is a field attempting to accomplish such tasks with computers. By default robots are coined as “intelligent”.</p>
