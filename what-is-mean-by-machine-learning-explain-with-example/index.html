What is Machine Learning? p.4 Realworld Examples and Applications From sebastian-mantey.com
Machine learning can be confusing, so it is important that we begin by clearly defining the term: For example, if your model is trying to predict whether your friends will go golfing or not, you might have variables like the temperature, the day. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. Smartphones use personal voice assistants like siri, alexa, cortana, etc.
