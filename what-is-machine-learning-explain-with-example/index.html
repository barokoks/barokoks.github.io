In this case, the machinery isn’t necessarily performing a task that is difficult for. Machine learning, however, is the part of ai that allows machines to learn from the hoards of data it receives without explicitly being programmed. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error.
