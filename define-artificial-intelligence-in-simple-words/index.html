What is Artificial Intelligence? Basic Concepts and Advantages of AI From educba.com
Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. The benchmark for ai is the human level concerning in teams of reasoning, speech, and vision. Artificial intelligence is technology that behaves intelligently using skills associated with human intelligence, including the ability to perceive, learn, reason and act autonomously.
