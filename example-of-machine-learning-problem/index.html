Will the ml model be able to learn? The data set consist of 370 features and the target value we need to predict. To present a very simple example in which you were attempting to train a model that predicts a &#43; b = c using supervised machine learning, you would give it a set of observations of a, b, and the outcome c. Machine learning and deep learning are extremely similar, in fact deep learning is simply a subset of machine learning.
