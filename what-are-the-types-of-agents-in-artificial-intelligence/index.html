Agents in Artificial Intelligence Coding Ninjas Blog From codingninjas.com
These almost embody the all intelligent agent systems. There are four basic kinds of agent programs that embody the principles underlying almost all intelligent systems. We have claimed that ai is interesting, but we have not said what it is. Agents can be grouped into four classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability.

Similarly, the robot agent has a camera, mic as sensors and motors for effectors. Of these agents can improve their performance and generate better action over time. Single agent / multiple agents − the environment may contain other agents which may be of the same or different kind as that of the agent. Agents can be grouped into four classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability : As human has ears, eyes, and other organs for sensors, and hands, legs and other body parts for effectors.</p>
