12step engineering design process (International Technology and From researchgate.net
The architectural design process has seven main design phases, each of which plays a critical role in the success of the project. Note that the process is shown below as a circular process, but a typical engineering design often goes back and forth. Feed or front end engineering design is the most basic engineering conducted after completion of the conceptual design and feasibility study. This first series is based on 5th grade science.
