Ai and machine learning algorithms can be trained to help reduce or eliminate bias by promoting data diversity and transparency to help address health inequities. Here are the examples of artificial intelligence in healthcare1) artificial intelligence assistance in “keeping well” 1) artificial intelligence assistance in “keeping well” one of the biggest and directly consumer impacting potential. But true to the ai’s prediction, the patient eventually woke up. Ai helps to reduce manual errors and improve diagnostic process.
