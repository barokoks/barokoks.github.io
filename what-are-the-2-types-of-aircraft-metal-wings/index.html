It is as strong as steel, but only half the weight. The tricycle gear aircraft is a kind of plane that has tricycle fashion fixed landing gear. It’s also not uncommon for wings to place winglets on the tips to help with lifting. There are therefore two primary types of loading that the wing structure must be designed to withstand.

A bending moment arising from the lift distribution. There are two ways to determine rivet size: Aircraft with wood wing spars may have wood or metal ribs while most aircraft with metal spars have metal ribs.
