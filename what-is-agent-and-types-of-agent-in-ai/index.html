Artificial Intelligence Chapter two agents From slideshare.net
A human agent has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin parallel to the sensors, and other organs such as hands, legs, mouth, for effectors. There are certain diagrams that describe each of these ia classes. An agent has an objective function that encapsulates all the ia�s goals. The idea is that an agent can represent knowledge of its world, its goals and the current situation by sentences in logic and decide what to do by inferring that a certain action or course of action is appropriate to achieve its goals. john mccarthy in concepts of logical ai, 2000.
