There Are Many Ways to Define Artificial Intelligence, Says Intel · EMSNow From emsnow.com
He said, ‘every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. Artificial intelligence has grown to be very popular in today’s world. Alan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question �can machines think�? he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks, to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn.
