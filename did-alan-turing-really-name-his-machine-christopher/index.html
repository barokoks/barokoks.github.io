Alan turing, while a mathematics student at the university of cambridge, was inspired by german mathematician david hilbert’s formalist program, which sought to demonstrate that any mathematical problem can potentially be solved by an algorithm—that is, by a purely mechanical process. Turing interpreted this to mean a computing machine and set out. The machines (several models were used) used during the war had some differences in design, and a lot more complexity. It was turing�s doctoral advisor, alonzo church, who later coined the term turing machine in a review.

In the film, turing tells clarke that he named the machine “christopher.” (the audience knows it’s named after turing’s first love, though clarke doesn’t know that part.)
