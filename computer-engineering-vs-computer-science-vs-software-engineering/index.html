Computer science actually does apply computer programming the same way as software engineering does, but it mostly focuses on the feasibility of its design. Engineers apply the knowledge of math &amp; science to design and manufacture maintainable systems used to solve specific problems. Computer science students will study how data is stored, processed and applied by computers and other computing devices. The differences between software engineering and computer science are due to computer science being more concerned with theory and software engineering with the practical application of knowledge to build software. One of the biggest differences lies in the roles of these two positions.</p>
