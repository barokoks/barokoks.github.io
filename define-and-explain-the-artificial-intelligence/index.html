What is Artificial Intelligence? Basic Concepts and Advantages of AI From educba.com
Build systems that think exactly like humans do (“strong ai”) Ai is not a single technology. Definitions of artificial intelligence begin to shift based upon the goals that are trying to be achieved with an ai system. It is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines that are programmed to learn and mimic the actions of humans.

Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science.</p>
