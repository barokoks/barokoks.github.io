Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Basic information on pollutants and sources of indoor air pollution. Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land. Air pollution consists of chemicals or particle s.</p>

The issue, however, is not limited to coastal environments; The combustion of gasoline and other hydrocarbon fuels in automobiles, trucks and jet airplanes produces several primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, gaseous hydrocar­bons and carbon monoxide as well as large quantities of particulates,.</p>
