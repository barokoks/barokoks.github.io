<p>Learn Artificial intelligence in 17 Minutes what is AI ? YouTube Ai (artificial intelligence) is a machineâs ability to perform cognitive functions as humans do, such as perceiving, learning, reasoning, and solving problems. It carries out an action with the best outcome after considering past and current percepts (agentâs perceptual inputs at a given instance). Classification algorithms are part of supervised learning. Ai can perceive, learn, analyze, and deduce while it.</p>
