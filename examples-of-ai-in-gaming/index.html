Is it clear straight, is it clear left, is it clear right, is food straight, is food left, is food right (designing ai, 2017). If you’ve ever played the classic game pacman, then you’ve experienced one of the most famous examples of early ai. The application of the term “artificial intelligence” might be a misnomer, as many games don’t use true ai techniques. As pacman tries to collect all the dots on the screen, he is ruthlessly pursued by four different colored ghosts.
