Artificial intelligence is a part of computer science, it is a subset of computer science. Instead, artificial intelligence developers locate and pull data from a variety of sources, create, develop and test machine learning models and then utilize application program interface (api) calls or embedded code to build and. Jobs like ai data analysts, prominent data engineers require a combined knowledge of data science and artificial intelligence. Skills needed to become an ai engineer or researcher.
