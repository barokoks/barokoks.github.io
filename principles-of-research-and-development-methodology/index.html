<p>UX Process and Skills Diagrams Make It Easy! Sometimes, the new knowledge leads to new products or processes, and sometimes it doesnï¿½t. The first part of the chapter focuses on the rationale and basic principles of development research by outlining motives for conducting formative research, analyzing definitions and aims of various types of development research, and discussing. And principles associated with a branch of knowledge. Basic research focuses.</p>

<p>Development Methodologies Creating Tomorrowï¿½s Software Today They distinguish three types of development research as by basic research, applied research, and routine research. When planning your methods, there are two key decisions you will make. Basic research focuses on fundamental aspects of methodology, applied research focuses on the application of research principles to generate evidence to answer policy questions, and routine research is Preparing the research design.</p>
