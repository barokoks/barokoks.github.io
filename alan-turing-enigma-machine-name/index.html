Alan Turing And ENIGMA! Social Pakora From socialpakora.com
Turing pitted machine against machine. But it is not the only scientific contribution inventors or scientists did during this period of time. Often remembered for his contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence and modern computer science (before either even existed), turing is probably best known for what is now dubbed the “turing test.”. It is a process of testing a machine’s.
