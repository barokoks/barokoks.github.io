CAD/CAM in Industry 4.0.</h3><p>This will lead to greater efficiencies and changing traditional production relationships between suppliers, producers and customers. The expression used for this fourth industrial revolution is industry 4.0, an idiom that is a rumination of software revision labelling. The term industry 4.0 was first publicly introduced in 2011 as âindustrie 4.0â by a group of representatives from different fields (such as business, politics, and academia) under an initiative to enhance the german competitiveness in the manufacturing industry. Industry 4.0, which encompasses iiot and smart manufacturing, marries physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management. Industry 4.0 is the application of technology to digitally transform how industrial companies operate. These technologies include the industrial iot, automation and robotics, predictive maintenance, simulation, additive manufacturing, and iot analytics.</p>
<p>Industry 4.0 is driven by a need to boost efficiency, become more agile to respond to market. This shift is enabled by a set of technologies including autonomous robots, simulation technology, system integration, the internet of things (iot), cybersecurity, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, augmented reality and big data. Industry 4.0, in my point of view, is a combination of many technologies that focus on a higher performance. automation industry 4.0 represents the next step in productivity with the exploitation of the main technologies available today, such as iiot, 3d printing, wireless, hmis, and others that will enable optimized levels of productivity. <em>CAD/CAM in Industry 4.0</em>, An online service that provides technical writing help to students mentions that industry 4.0 is still using resources used by its predecessors, such as electricity, electronics, it, and automated systems.</p>
