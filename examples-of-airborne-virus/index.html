A common way this happens is when a person breathes in the hantavirus from the air. Some scientists are speculating that the infectious particles of the coronavirus may linger in the air for several hours, so, for example, if you. A notable example is poultry that is often affected by an avian disorder (newcastle disease), which is also transmitted via an airborne route. However, it is important to understand that exposure to an animal or a patient with an airborne disease does not automatically ensure disease transmission.
