How SHARP Air Purifier HEPA Filter works? YouTube From youtube.com
An indoor air purifier ensures the filtration of the indoor air, of an enclosed space, which it captures to release a depolluted air. The passive air purifiers are seen as more effective because all dirt is permanently removed from the air and kept in the air filters. Simply put, it works by sucking in the air, running it through the filters, and expelling clean air. The device processes the air and strips it of pollutants, effectively.
