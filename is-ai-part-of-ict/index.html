This report provides an introduction into how artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to support and enhance the accessibility of information and communication technologies (icts). Ict intelligence empowers organisations to move through a maturity module driving advanced analytics with ai and machine learning. Ict, or information and communications technology, is a broad term for digital infrastructure including software platforms, foundational services, networks and data centers.
