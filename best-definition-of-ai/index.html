What is Artificial Intelligence [AI]? Definition, Features and Uses From computertechreviews.com
A definition of artificial intelligence: Simply stated, artificial intelligence (ai) is “human intelligence or behaviour demonstrated by machines”. It is the process of learning by processing and analyzing the input data by several methods until the machine discovers the single desirable output. The term is used to describe machines that mimic cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving.
