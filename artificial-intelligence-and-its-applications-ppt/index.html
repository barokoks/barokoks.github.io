Ai is a branch of computer science. Finance • banks use artificial intelligence systems to organize operations, invest in stocks, and manage properties • loan investigation, atm design, safe and fast banking etc. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. To understand and profit from experience a general mental capability that involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend ideas and language, and learn is effectively perceiving, interpreting and responding to the environment none of these tells us what intelligence is, so instead, maybe we can.
