Basic chemicals are produced on a large scale and used as raw materials in manufacturing of other products. Chemicals generally are classified into two groups: The unit operation like distillation, absorption, evaporation, filtration, drying, etc. Central to the modern world economy, it converts raw materials (oil, natural gas, air, water, metals, and minerals) into more than 70,000 different products.
