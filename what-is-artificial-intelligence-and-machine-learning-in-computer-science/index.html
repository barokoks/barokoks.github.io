Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being. Ibm has a rich history with machine learning. The goal of ai is to make a smart computer system like humans to solve complex problems. Hence, artificial intelligence is a sub branch of computer science and its primary goal is to build intelligence through machines, to help.
