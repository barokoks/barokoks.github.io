Aima, pydatalog, simpleai, easyai are the general libraries for ai available in python. Developed in 1991, python has been a poll that suggests over 57% of developers are more likely to pick python over c&#43;&#43; as their programming language of choice for developing ai solutions. Ai has come a long way to help businesses expand and accomplish their full potential. All these features provide a surprisingly powerful and flexible programming framework.
