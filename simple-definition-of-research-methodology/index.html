Definition and types of research From slideshare.net
Therefore, the basic concept of research methodology is defined as a highly intellectual. Research methodology ensures the employment of the correct procedures to solve the problems. In fact, research is an art of scientific investigation. The methodology in a research paper, thesis paper or dissertation is the section in which you describe the actions you took to investigate and research a problem and your rationale for the specific processes and techniques you use within your research to identify, collect and analyze information that helps you understand the problem.
