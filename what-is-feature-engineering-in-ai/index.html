Industrializing AI &amp; Machine Learning Applications with Kubeflow by From towardsdatascience.com
If you think of the data is the crude oil of the 21st century, then this step is where it gets refined, and gets a boost in its value. Feature engineering means transforming raw data into a feature vector. Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones. A feature is a measurable property of the object you’re trying to analyze.
