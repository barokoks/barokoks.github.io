AI, Machine Learning, &amp; Deep Learning Explained in 5 Minutes From becominghuman.ai
Here is the difference between ai and machine learning. Not all ai is machine learning. Algorithms whose performance improve as they are exposed to more data over time. Artificial intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart and machine learning is a current application of ai based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.
