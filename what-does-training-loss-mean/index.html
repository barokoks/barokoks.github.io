Neural network uses optimising strategies like stochastic gradient descent to minimize the error in the algorithm. This means model is cramming values not learning. With either method, since the loss depends on the. The training.</p>

It is usually a good idea to monitor the loss function, on the training and validation set. For training loss, keras does a running average over the batches.
