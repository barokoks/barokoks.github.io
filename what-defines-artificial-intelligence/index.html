Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Alan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question �can machines think�? he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks, to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Maybe that’s why it seems as though everyone’s definition of.
