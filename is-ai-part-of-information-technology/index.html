<p>Artificial Intelligence An Overview of Its Applications and UseCases While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 106 kb) (link resides outside ibm),  it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Ai is not a single technology. Why is building a secure system important.</p>

<p>The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to There is a big debate on whether artificial intelligence (ai) is a part of computer science or it is a branch on its own. Artificial intelligence (ai) is the combined attribute of science and computer that makes the system or program or any machines perform the intelligent and imaginative functions of a human, independently and solution to problems, be able.</p>
