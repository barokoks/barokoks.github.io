Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training). Knowledge is the information acquired through experience. Weak ai, also known as narrow ai, is an ai system that is designed and trained to complete a specific task.

The application of the term “artificial intelligence” might be a misnomer, as many games don’t use true ai techniques.

<p>How does artificial intelligence work, and what do people mean when Even for traditional game developers, the increasing use of ai in games means a change in the way games are created. Artificial intelligence (ai), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building and managing technology that can learn to autonomously make decisions and carry out actions on behalf of a human being.
