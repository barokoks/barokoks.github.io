Artificial Intelligence Definition and Categorization Technologynous From technologynous.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. So, in other words, machines learn to think like humans, by observing and learning from humans.

<p>What is Artificial Intelligence? Everything You Need To Know GK Stuffs It is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines that are programmed to learn and mimic the actions of humans. How people interact, how people behave, how people react etc. These machines are able to learn. Ai is getting used across different industries including finance and healthcare. Ai is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn,.</p>
