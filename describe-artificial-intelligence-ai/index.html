Artificial Intelligence Definition and Categorization Technologynous From technologynous.com
Artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. So, in other words, machines learn to think like humans, by observing and learning from humans.
