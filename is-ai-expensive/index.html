What Does AI Actually Cost?. *This is a modified version of a lesson From medium.com
But all of these applications of today’s ai do have a barrier to entry, and that is cost. Ai has so many uses, yet the main reason why more companies don�t use it is the cost. Furthermore, there are many ai applications in some areas, such as healthcare, business, education, finance, law and others. Since 2002 more then $3.8b have been raised by ai companies [10].
