Agriculture What Role Is Artificial Intelligence Playing? Longevity LIVE From longevitylive.com
We know that artificial intelligence excels at image processing — computers can now “see” almost as well as we can. The team—which includes biologists, agronomists, nutritionists, and policy analysts working with data scientists—is using big data tools to create ai systems that can predict the potential outcomes. Artificial intelligence in agriculture has brought an agriculture revolution. Capitalizing on the value of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (ai), blockchain, drones and the internet of things (iot) has the potential to impact productivity and efficiency at all stages emerging technologies from drones to
