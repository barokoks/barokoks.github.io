The risks of these occurring can vary greatly. Researchers found that persistent exposure to lavender oil products is associated with premature breast development in girls, and abnormal breast development in boys. Effects of endocrine disruption have been reported in snails, mussels, crustaceans, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals.
