<p>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for L&amp;D Degreed Blog The artificial intelligence is the next step in this process to make it more effective by applying logical, analytical, and more productive technologies into this effort. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn. Ai which stands for.</p>

<p>There Are Many Ways to Define Artificial Intelligence, Says Intel · EMSNow Today, the term artificial intelligence (ai) is thrown around rather generously. There is no precise definition of ai, and the meaning has evolved over time, but a number of technologies are generally understood. Simply stated, artificial intelligence (ai) is “human intelligence or behaviour demonstrated by machines”. If it sounds like computers are getting better at doing the kinds of things.</p>
