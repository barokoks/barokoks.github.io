Cognitive Computing in Insurance Going Beyond Predictive Analytics From youtube.com
It often coincides with ai and involves many related technologies to power applications, including robotics, neural networks, expert systems, and virtual and augmented. Cognitive computing enables machines to actually think and learn the same way that humans do. Cognitive computing makes a new class of problems computable, which addresses complex situations that are characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty. Is it all about cognitive computing?
