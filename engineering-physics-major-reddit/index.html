While one can get an economics degree without as much math as a physics degree (in theory, at least), as far as the amount of mathematics used on the job, it�s not true in general that physics requires substantially more math. These abilities are acquired through both course..</p>

<li>mechanical engineers do not fix machines, they design them and leave the fixing to technicians. The goal of physics is to understand how things work from first principles. If you want to go into industry, it may not be the best idea. Students in engineering physics learn how to apply the knowledge of the fundamental physical principles underlying modern technology and processes. Electrical engineers deal with a lot of abstract concepts, and electricity in itself is not something we understand in a natural way. They use this skill set to work on and improve every set of electrical equipment there is.</li>

<p>This should make it easier to find a job with an electrical engineering degree. The structure of the program is very similar to that of electrical engineering except the depth. Physics to ee is easier down the road than ee to physics. <em>Every note / test / assignment from a 5 year engineering physics and</em>, Win/spr lunch for prospective physics &amp; engineering physics majors.</p>
