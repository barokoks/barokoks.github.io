Artificial intelligence (ai) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment. The super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by ibm, and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match (which deep blue had lost), reportedly 200,000,000 moves per second. What does artificial intelligence (ai) mean? The evolution of artificial intelligence (ai) grew with the complexity of the languages available for development.
