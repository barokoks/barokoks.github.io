Artificial intelligence is about creating intelligent systems. Ml will go for solution whether it is optimal or not. I would personally say that data science has a better future as it is a broader field as compared to machine learning. Dissertation topics machine learning for intelligent management can be a research topic good for training and evaluation purposes when it comes to data.

<p>The Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning It is developing a system which mimics humans to solve problems. Artificial intelligence is a domain of computer science, as the word says intelligence, machine acts intelligently as we give some inputs to the machine. A linear regression is not artificial intelligence, nor is a logistic regression, nor is a support vector machine, nor a neural network. Today, artificial intelligence.</p>

Artificial intelligence is a domain of computer science, as the word says intelligence, machine acts intelligently as we give some inputs to the machine. Why humans learn faster than aiâfor now. Artificial intelligence is about creating intelligent systems..</p>
