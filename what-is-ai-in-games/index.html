<p>How is AI Changing the Game Testing Industry? TechPocket To begin with, game environments and models are increasingly becoming popular training mechanisms for machine learning, including imitation learning or reinforcement learning. In the future, game developers will likely work to fully integrate ai into a game’s framework so that the ai will learn from itself and continue to.

Game theory is basically a branch of mathematics that is used to typical strategic interaction between different players (agents), all of which are equally rational, in a context with predefined rules (of playing or maneuvering) and outcomes. But the advances in ai won’t. And the person responsible.</p>
