China�s Air Pollution by Angela Sang From haikudeck.com
Coal accounts for 16.7% of all air pollution, and vehicles for 22%. Air pollution in china can be particularly bad in winter months as it is also used to power the centralized heating system in the northern cities of china It is clear that there are numerous reasons that lead to the serious air pollution and the according consequences in beijing. In 2021, china’s major cities saw an overall reduction in pm2.5 by 2.5% and a noticeable drop in ozone.
