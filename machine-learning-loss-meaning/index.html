<p>machine learning Comparing MSE loss and crossentropy loss in terms Most machine learning algorithms use some sort of loss function in the process of optimization or finding the best parameters (weights) for your data. You divide the sum of squared differences by n, which corresponds to the length of the vectors. Gradually, with the help of some optimization function, loss function learns to reduce the error in prediction. This function.</p>

<p>machine learning Tensorflow No gradients provided for any variable For a perfect model, log loss value = 0. This function returns a variable called history that contains a trace of the loss and any other. Loss value implies how well or poorly a certain model behaves after each iteration of optimization. The term cost function is also used equivalently. This model learns as it goes by using trial and.</p>
