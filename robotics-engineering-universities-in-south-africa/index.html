<meta name="description" content="Robotics Engineering Universities In South Africa, The robotics and mechatronics research group views collaboration as imperative and works closely with the control and instrumentation research group in the department of electrical engineering, as well as with researchers in the mechanical and biomedical engineering departments. First tech challenge students learn to think like engineers.
Universities, Colleges and Higher Learning Institutions in Africa (News From skyscrapercity.com
The international conference on robotics and automation took place in brisbane, australia, the first time the conference took place in the southern hemisphere. Teaching robotics in schools gives students the opportunity to address the growing demand for teaching stem subjects while learning how science, engineering, math, and technology work together and interact. Robotics is recognised as a strategic priority both by government and the university, with strong growth expected in the sector. Jefa (junior engineers for africa) was initiated in 2005 by brenda windram.
