Workflows, case studies, and processes | by chen ye | hh design | medium. The engineering design process is the process in which engineers solve problems. If we don’t define the problem, it will lead to a failed design that won’t work and will only delay the project. In a company that offers products such as christmas, anniversary, commemorative cards, etc., renewing the stock and changing the design of the cards is constantly fundamental.

If we don’t define the problem, it will lead to a failed design that won’t work and will only delay the project. Let’s take an example that you are working on a project. The front portion of a car is designed to crumple on impact in order to lengthen the impact, lowering the force on the passengers. This last example is one of our favorites. Define the problem, do research, think of solutions, build a prototype, test your solution, and redesign your solution or accept.</p>
