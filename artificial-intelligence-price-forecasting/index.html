When crude oil prices began to escalate in the 1970s, conventional methods were the predominant methods used in forecasting oil pricing. However, technical indicators are still widely used for stock price forecasting and have been proven to be effective in many works (e.g., oriani and coelho, 2016; A response to demand volatility is demand forecasting using artificial intelligence.
