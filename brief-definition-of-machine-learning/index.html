Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. Until the late 1970s, it was a part of ai’s. Machine learning contains a set of algorithms that work on a huge amount of data.

Machine learning is a tool for turning information into knowledge. “machine learning is defined as the study of computer programs that leverage algorithms and statistical models to learn through inference and patterns without being explicitly programed. Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence which combines data with statistical tools to predict an output which can be used to make actionable insights. Machine learning research is part of research on artificial intelligence, seeking to provide knowledge to computers through data, observations and interacting with the world. Ai processes data to make decisions and predictions.</p>
