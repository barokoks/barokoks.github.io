Interoperability is one of the key aspects of the iot that contribute to. Things like smart appliances, smart lights, and smart door locks are all examples of iot that you might find in someone�s home. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. The internet of things brings all the benefits of the internet to items like lightbulbs and thermostats, but it brings all the problems of the internet, too.
