<p>The biggest obstacle to humanlike artificial intelligence The starting point is easy. Artificial intelligence (ai) is a broad branch of computer science that is focused on a machine’s capability to produce rational behavior from external inputs. The more humanlike the desired outcome, the more data and processing power required. A layman with a fleeting understanding of technology would link it to robots. The term is frequently applied.</p>
