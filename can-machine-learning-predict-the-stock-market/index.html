Can Machine Learning Models Accurately Predict The Stock Market? From smartdatacollective.com
Welcome to the machine™, an advanced machine learning algorithm we built to try to predict tomorrow�s trading range (high &amp; low). One can learn stock market prediction using machine learning projects on public forums such as kaggle to understand how basic to intermediate level models can be created. The stock market is known for being volatile, dynamic, and nonlinear. My goal is to find correlation between some features i can measure about the company and the stock price.
