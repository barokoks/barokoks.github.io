Artificial Intelligence Surpasses Human Understanding From theinsurancebuzz.com
According to #psychologists, there are four types of #intelligence: In this article, there is a free iq test where you get detailed results by artificial intelligence about your iq and personality. Iq, which i associate as niq, represents one’s natural intelligence. Such tests evaluate intelligence development levels, or grades, of intelligent systems at the time of testing, with the results delineating the ai iq of the system at testing time.
