Drawing terms on emaze From app.emaze.com
Usually, a number of drawings are necessary to completely specify even a simple component. An engineering design is usually defined by many individual detail drawings which combine to form an assembly drawing. In a civil engineering drawing, the scale is maintained religiously all throughout the documents. An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object.
