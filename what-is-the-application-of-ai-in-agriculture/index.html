How AI Can Help In Agriculture — Five Applications and Use Cases by From medium.com
They can’t see how it can help them work on the physical earth. Ai may be useful, there is still much work to be done by. Beyond simply providing greater insight and visibility into supply chains, ai is helping to optimize food production and preparation. Their resistance is due to a lack of understanding of the practical use of ai tools.
