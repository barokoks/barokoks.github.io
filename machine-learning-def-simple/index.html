Définition Deep Learning Actualité Informatique From actualiteinformatique.fr
Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an “artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own. I’ve tried to cover the ten most important machine learning methods: Within that is deep learning, and then neural networks within that. At the very basic level, machine learning uses algorithms to find patterns and then applies the patterns moving forward.

Instead of following static rules coded in a program, ml technology identifies input patterns and contains algorithms that evolve over time. Machine learning is a field of computer science that aims to teach computers how to learn and act without being explicitly programmed. The idea behind learning is very simple and intuitive. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which deals with neural networks. Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals:</p>
